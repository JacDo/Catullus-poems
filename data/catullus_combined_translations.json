      "Negenborn": "O, inhabitant of the mountain of Helicon, son of\nUrania, who seize a dainty young woman and carry her off to\na man, o Hymenaeus, Hymen! o Hymenaeus Hymen! Crown your\ntemples with flowers, take your flame-colored veil, pleasant\nwith fragrant marjoram, and come over here, wearing a\nreddish yellow slipper on a snow-white foot! And having been\nroused from sleep on a cheerful day, singing wedding songs\nin a high-pitched voice, strike the ground with your feet,\nand shake the pinewood marriage-torch with your hand! Good\nvirgin Junia dons the veil for Manius with a good omen, like\nVenus, who dwells in Idalium, as she came to Paris, the\nPhrygian judge. And she is just like an Asian myrtle tree\nshining forth with small, flowery branches, which the wood\nnymphs nurture with dewy moisture, as amusement for\nthemselves. Therefore come, making an approach over here,\nand continue, leaving behind the Aonian caves of the\nThespian rock, the caves which the nymph Aganippe makes wet\nas she cools them from above. And call the mistress,\ndesirous of her new husband, home, as you bind their minds\nwith love, like wandering ivy clinging to a tree in a\ntangle! Likewise, you unmarried virgins, whose own wedding\nday, as well, is coming soon, act in the right and proper\nway, and sing, O Hymenaeus Hymen! o Hymenaeus Hymen, in\norder that the leader of good Venus, the one who conjoins\ngood love, might make his approach over here more gladly\nwhen he hears himself being called to the task. Which god is\nmore to be sought by lovers who are loved? Which of the gods\nwill people look after the more, o Hymenaeus Hymen, o\nHymenaeus Hymen? Sex can seize nothing of benefit without\nyou, because a good reputation demonstrates ones goodness,\nbut sex can do this when you are willing. Who would dare be\ncompared to this god? Without you, no family can give\nchildren, and no parent can rely on his offspring, but he\ncan when you are willing. Who would dare be compared to this\ngod? A land that lacked your holy rites would not be able to\ngive guardians to its borders: but it would if you were\nwilling. Who would dare be compared to this god? Open the\nbars of the door. There is a young woman. Do you see how the\nmarriage torches shake their fiery locks? ....A natural\nsense of shame may delay the bride. Nevertheless, hearing\nher shame the more, she weeps because she must go. Stop\ncrying, Junia. In your case, there is no danger that a\nprettier woman has seen the rising light of day. Such a\nhyacinth-colored flower usually stands in the multicolored\nlittle garden of a wealthy lord. But you are dallying, and\nthe day is ending. Please go forth as the bride. Please\nadvance as the bride, if it seems proper at this time, and\nhear our words. See? The wedding torches shake their golden\nlocks: please advance as the bride. Your husband is not\nfickle; not devoted to a bad mistress, he does not pursue\nindecent scandals, and he wont want to sleep apart from\nyour dainty little breasts; but just as a supple vine\nentwines with trees planted nearby, he will become entangled\nin your embrace. But the day is ending. Please go forth as\nthe bride. O marriage bed, which for everyone... How\nnumerous the pleasures of the ivory-footed marriage bed come\nto your husband, which, on a restless night, and in the\nmiddle of the day, may he enjoy! But the day is ending;\nplease go forth as the bride. Boys, raise the wedding-\ntorches; I see the flame-colored veil coming. Go and sing in\nunison, in the right and proper way: Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus,\nyo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! Lest the ribald Fescennine jesting\nbe silent for a long time, and the grooms catamite refuse\nnuts to boys as he hears about abandoned love. Give nuts to\nthe boys, lazy catamite! You have played with nuts long\nenough: now it pleases Hymenaeus to be of service. Catamite,\ngive nuts. You considered farm managers wives unworthy of\nyour attention, today and yesterday. Now your hairdresser\nshaves your beard. O wretched, wretched catamite, give nuts!\nAnointed groom, you will be criticized for keeping away from\nyour bald, effeminate slaves, but keep away from them. Yo!\nHymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! We know that these\npeccadilloes (which are permitted to you) are the only ones\nyou have known, but they are not permitted to a married man.\nYo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! Wife, beware\nlest you deny the things that both you and your husband\nseek, lest he go to seek them from elsewhere. Yo! Hymen\nHymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! Behold how powerful and\nwealthy your husbands house is, which is in your interest:\nallow it to be of service to you (Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo!\nYo! Hymen Hymenaeus!) until old white-haired womanhood,\nnodding her tremulous head, nods assent to everything for\neveryone. Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! With\na good omen, carry your gold-colored little feet over the\nthreshold, and go beneath the door of polished wood. Yo!\nHymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! Look inside in\norder that your husband, reclining in his crimson bed, might\nbe completely intent on you. Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo!\nHymen Hymenaeus! A flame burns no less ardently in his\ninnermost heart than in yours, but secretly, even more so.\nYo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! Young man,\ngive your smooth little arm to the maiden; let her visit her\nhusbands bed now. Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus, yo! Yo! Hymen\nHymenaeus! You good women, well known by your aged husbands,\narray the maiden on her marriage bed. Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus,\nyo! Yo! Hymen Hymenaeus! You may come now, bridegroom: your\nwife is in the marriage chamber, and her countenance is\nflowery and radiant, like the white chamomile or the red\npoppy. But (thus may the gods help me) you are no less\nhandsome, o bridegroom, and Venus is not indifferent to you.\nBut the day is ending. Proceed, and do not dally. You have\nnot waited long; now you are coming. May good Venus be of\nhelp to you, since what you desire you desire openly, and\nyou do not conceal your good love. Let him who wishes to\ncount the many thousands of your love-plays first calculate\nthe amount of sand in Africa and the number of twinkling\nstars! Play as you like, and within a short time, produce\nchildren. It isnt fitting for an old name to be without\nchildren, but it is fitting for them to be engendered from\nthe same family. I want Torquatus to laugh sweetly, with a\nhalf-open lip, as, from his mothers lap, he stretches out\nhis delicate hand to his father. May he be like his father\nManlius, and easily recognized by everyone who is unknowing,\nand may he declare the sexual fidelity of his mother by\nmouth! May the virtue from his good mother prove the\nexcellence of his family, just as the peerless flame remains\nfor Telemachus from his excellent mother, Penelope. Close\nthe doors of the marriage chamber, young ladies: we have\nplayed enough. But, good newlyweds, live well and spend your\nvigorous youth in incessant conjugal activity!\nTaken with kind permission from Brendan",

      "Wikisource": "You who dwell on Helicon Hill, Sprung from Urania, Who carry off to her mate The gentle virgin, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Twine round your temples Sweet-smelling flowers of marjoram; Put on your gold-tinted veil; Lighthearted here, come here, Bearing on snowy foot the golden-yellow sandal: And afire with the joyous day, Chanting wedding melodies With ringing voice, Strike the ground with your feet, with your hand Swing aloft the torch of pine. For Vinia—fair as Venus Dwelling in Idalium when Came to the Phrygian judge— A virgin fair, weds Manlius Amid happy auspices. She, bright-shining As the Asian myrtle florid in its branches, Which the Hamadryads Nurture for their pleasure With besprinkled dew. So come then! Convey your approach here, Leaving the Aonian cave in Cliffs of Thespiae, over which flows The chilling stream of Aganippe. And summon homewards the mistress, Eager for her new husband, Firm-prisoning her soul in love; As tight-clasping ivy, wandering here and there, Wraps the tree around. And also you, upright virgins, For whom a like day is nearing, Chant in cadence, singing “O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus!” That more freely, hearing himself Called to his duty, Will he bear here his presence, Lord of honorable love, Uniter of true lovers. What god is worthier To be sought by anxious lovers? Whom of the celestials do men worship more greatly? O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus! You for his young the trembling father beseeches, for you virgins unclasp The belt from their breasts, for you the fearful bridegroom Harkens with eager ear. You deliver into the hands of the untamed youth That flower-like maiden, Taken from her mother's bosom, O Hymenaeus Hymen, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Without you Venus can do nothing Suitable that good Repute sanctions; but she can, With you willing. Who dares to be compared With such a god? Without you, no house Can produce heirs, no parent Be surrounded by offspring; but they can, With you willing. Who dares to be compared With such a god? And lacking your rites no land Can give protection To its territory; but it can, with you willing. Who dares to be compared With such a god? Unbolt, open the gates: The virgin is here. See how the torches shake their gleaming locks? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Her natural modesty detains her: Hearing this the more, She weeps because she must go. Cease your tears. For you there is no peril, Aurunculeia, that any woman more beauteous Will ever see the light of day Coming from Ocean. You are like the hyacinth flower, Which stands aloft Amid varied riches of its master's garden. But you delay, day slips by: Advance, new bride. Advance, new bride, if it now seems right, And listen to our speech. See how the torches Shake their glittering tresses: Advance, new bride. Nor is your man a fickle husband, Given to ill adulteries, Seeking shameless acts, Ever wishing to lie away From your soft breasts, But as the lithe vine among Neighbouring trees doth cling, So shall he be enclasped in your embrace. But day slips by: Advance, new bride. O nuptial couch which for all . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . With feet of ivory white. What joys are coming to your man In fleeting night, In noon of day, let him rejoice! But day slips by: Advance, new bride. Raise high, O boys, the torches: I see the gleaming veil approach. Come, chant in cadence, “O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus.” Nor longer silent is Lewd Fescinnine jest, Nor, favorite, hearing Your master's love has flown, Deny the nuts to the boys. Give nuts to the boys, O listless favorite; Long enough have you played nuts: Now you must serve Talassius. O favorite, give the nuts! The country wives were dirt to you, O favorite, but yesterday: Now the barber Shaves your face. Wretched, wretched Favorite, give the nuts. They will say when the bridegroom has been annointed That you can scarce Abstain from your hairless boys: but abstain! O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus. We know that these delights were known to you Only when lawful: but to the wedded these same delights Are lawful no more. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! You also, bride, what your husband seeks Beware of denying, Lest he go elsewhere in its search. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Look, your husband's home is yours, Influential and goodly, Allow it to serve you (O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus!) Until white-haired old age, Shaking your trembling brow, Nods assent to everything. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Bring with good omen your golden feet Across the threshold, And go through the polished doorway. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Look! your husband alone within, Lying on Tyrian couch, All-expectant waits for you. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! No less than in yours, In his breast burns an inmost flame, But more deeply inward. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus! Release the maiden's slender arm, Boy with crimson-bordered toga: Now let her approach her husband's couch. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus. You good women of fair renown To aged spouses, Put the maiden to bed. O Hymen Hymenaeus io, O Hymen Hymenaeus. Now you may come, bridegroom: Your wife is in the bedroom, With face brightly blushing As white parthenice Amid ruddy poppies. But, bridegroom (so help me the heaven-dwellers) An no way less beautiful are you, Nor does Venus slight you. But the day slips by: On! Do not delay. You have not delayed for long, Now you are coming. Kindly Venus will help you, Since what you desire you take publicly, And do not conceal true love. Whoever wishes to keep count of Your many thousand games, First let him make An accounting of the number of Africa's sands And the glittering stars. Play as you like, and speedily Give heirs. It does not become So old a name to without children, But from similar stock Always to be generated. A little Torquatus I wish, From his mother's lap Reaching out his dainty hands, And smiling sweetly at his father With lips apart. May he be like his father Manlius, And easily acknowledged By every stranger, And by his face point out His mother's faithfulness. May such praise Confirm his birth from true mother, Such fame as rests Only with Telemachus From best of mothers, Penelope. Close the doors, virgins: Enough we've played.

      "Wikisource": "The evening is come, rise up, young men: Vesper from Olympus now at last is just raising his long-looked-for light. Now is it time to rise, now to leave the rich tables; now will come the bride, now will the Hymen-song be sung. Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, be present, O Hymenaeus! See ye, maidens, the youths? Rise up to meet them. For sure the night-star shows his Oetaean fires. So it is indeed; see you how nimbly they have sprung up? not for nothing have they sprung up: they'll sing something worthwhile. Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! No easy palm is set out for us, comrades; look how the maidens are conning what they have learnt. Not in vain do they learn, they have there something worthy of memory; no wonder, since they labour deeply with their whole mind. We have diverted elsewhere our thoughts, elsewhere our ears; fairly then shall we be beaten; victory loveth care. Wherefore now at least match your minds with theirs. Anon they will begin to speak, anon it will be fitting for us to answer. Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! Hesperus, what more cruel fire than thine moves in the sky? for thou canst endure to tear the daughter from her mother's embrace, from her mother's embrace to tear the close-clinging daughter, and give the chaste maiden to the burning youth. What more cruel than this do enemies when a city falls? Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! Hesperus, what more welcome fire than thine shines in the sky? for thou with thy flame confirmest the contracted espousals, which husbands and parents have promised beforehand, but unite not till thy flame has arisen. What is given by the gods more desirable than the fortunate hour? Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! Hesperus, friends, has taken away one of us. For at thy coming the guard is always awake. By night thieves hide, whom thou, Hesperus, often overtakest back, Hesperus the same but with changed name Eous, But maidens love to chide thee with feigned complaint. What then, if they chide him whom they desire in their secret heart? Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! As a flower springs up secretly in a fenced garden, unknown to the cattle, torn up by no plough, which the winds caress, the sun strengthens, the shower draws forth, many boys, many girls, desire it; when the same flower fades, nipped by a sharp nail, no boys, no girls desire it: so a maiden, whilst she remains untouched, so long is she dear to her own; when she has lost her chaste flower with sullied body, she remains neither lovely to boys nor dear to girls. Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus! As an unwedded vine which grows up in a bare field never raises itself aloft, never brings forth a mellow grape, but bending its tender form with downward weight, even now touches the root with topmost shoot; no farmers, no oxen tend it: but if it chance to be joined in marriage to the elm, many farmers, many oxen tend it: so a maiden, whilst she remains untouched, so long is she aging untended; but when in ripe season she is matched in equal wedlock, she is more dear to her husband and less distasteful to her father. And you, maiden, strive not with such a husband; it is not right to strive with him to whom your father himself gave you, your father himself with your mother, whom you must obey. Your maidenhead is not all your own; partly it belongs to your parents, a third part is given to your father, a third part to your mother, only a third is yours; do not contend with two, who have given their rights to their son-in-law together with the dowry. Hymen, O Hymenaeus, Hymen, hither, O Hymenaeus!",

Companians to Me\nwith Me as Leader.\nYou've endured the wild sea and its deadly dangers\nand emasculated the body out of immense hatred of Venus.\nAmuse the Mistress with Your headlong tresspasses.\nLet's not tarry any longer, go together, follow Me\nto Cybebe's Phrygian House, to the Phrygian woods of the Goddess,\nwhere cymbals make their clashing sound, where drums resonate,\nwhere the Phrygian piper plays melancholically the curved reed,\nwhere the ivy-wearing Maenads shake Their heads violently,\nwhere They do Their offerings wailingly,\nwhere that roving crowd is used to flutter about for the Goddess,\nfor Whom it's right that We speed up the quick three-step dance.\"\nTogether with the Companians this Attis sang, the imitation-woman.\nSuddenly the Celebrants start wailing with oscillating tongues,\npromptly the drum bangs in return, the cymbals resound  with a ring.\nTo green Ida the swift Chorus goes in hot haste.\nIn rapture, out of breath and unsettled She walks on more dead than alive.\nWhile banging Her drum through the shadowy woods Attis is Leader.\nJust like an untamed heifer that tries to avoid the burden of the yoke,\nthe wild Gallae follow the swift-footed Leader.\nTherefore, as soon as They reached (3) Cybebe's House,\nThey out of enormous exertion go to sleep without having eaten.\nBecause of this trying exertion slothful Sleep covers the eyes.\nTheir minds at pleasant repose the wild rapture passes off.\nBut as the gold-faced Sun with His shining eyes\nbrightened the immaculate sky, the hard ground, the wild sea\nand dispelled the night's shadows with His sprightly horses,\nSleep left wide-awake Attis quickly forgetting all past exertion.\nInto fearful bosom the Goddess of all Gods and Goddesses(3)\nreceived Her back.\nSo after pleasant repose without the wild frenzy\nand likewise Her heart Attis recollected Her actions,\nand saw without all that with clear mind and where She'd been,\nat Her wit's end full of regret ran to the waters.\nThere Her eyes full of tears beholding the vast sea\nthe sad One(4) addressed Her Country with a voice so wretchedly:\n\"Country, O Creatress of Me, O My Country, Birthgiver,\nI such a wretch forsaking masters like fugitive\nslaves do, ran away to the woods of Ida,\nto be close to the snow and the ice-cold lairs of wild animals\nand go in rapture to all their hiding places,\nwhere somewhere You, Country, after all can also be found, I imagine ?\nThe same poplars long to direct their sharp tops to You,\n[or: The same piercing eyes long to direct them to You,]\nintend to keep aloof from wild frenzy, as long as life is short.\nWeren't I driven(2) from My home to these far away woods ?\nCountry, won't I be absent from good people, from friends and parents ?\nAbsent from the forum, the wrestling arena, the running course and\nthe gymnasia ?\nWretched ah wretched, it's forever to be deplored, Soul.\nTruely, what do I look like, aren't I therefore damned ?\nAm I a woman, a youth, a husband-to-be, a boy ?\nI was in top form, the attraction of the wrestling school:\nmany people frequently visited Me, Many kept Their houses cool for Me,\nMy house was adorned with garlands for Me,\npeople stood up for Me, where a seat faced the Sun rise.\nAm I now driven(2) to be a servant of gods(5) and Cybele's slave ?\nAm I to be(6) a Maenad, am I to play that part, to be a sterile man ?\nAm I to live in the cold, snow-coated place of green Ida ?\nAm I to spend My life under the high mountain tops of Phrygia,\nwhere the hind is a forest dweller, where the boar is a wood rover ?\nWhat I've done, distresses Me now, now I'm sorry.\"\nWhen She made a quick loud noise with Her rose lips, She left,\nthe new messenger addressing Her Self to the ears of the gods.\nThen, as Cybele takes(7) the joined yokes off the lions\nand incites the hostile animal on the left, thus She speaks:\n\"Go,\" She says,\"go, wild one, make this One like crazy,\nmake it so, that She through an attack of frenzy runs back to the woods,\nShe Who so very fearlessly wishes to flee at My command.\nGo, beat(2) Her skin with your tail, She must be exposed to your chastenings,\nmake it so, that the whole place resounds of your thundering roaring,\nshake your ruddy mane, wild one, with your muscular neck.\"\nThis asserts dangerous Cybebe and loosens the yokes with Her hand.\nThe wild animal itself urging itself takes off with all its courage,\nit wades, hullabaloos, breaks the underbrush on unsteady foot,\nbut as it nears the damp bright-white parts of the beach\nand sees the tender Attis near the marble (of the) sea,\nit makes its attack. That crazed One, She flees into the wild woods.\nThere for always and the whole space of Her life She was a Servant.\nGoddess, great Goddess, Cybebe, Goddess, Domina of Dindymon,\nmay all Your(8) Fury be far away from Me, Mistress, and far from home.\nDrive Others frantic, drive Others into rapture.\n[(1) In the Latin version of Verse 5 it says \"ili\", that should be \"illi\" = \"there on the stop\".]\n[(2) \"tetigere\" ?!  Shouldn't that be \"tetigunt\" ?\nLikewise \"ferar\" ... \"feror\", \"ferat\" ... \"fert\" ?\nLikewise \"caeda\" ... \"caede\" ?]\n[(3) \"Pasitheia\" = \"Pas + Théia\". Plural of \"Théion\" = \"a divine being\". \"Pas\"= \"All\".]\n[(4) \"maestast\" = \"maesta\"+ \"est\". Likewise: \"figurast\" = \"figura\" + \"est\"]\n[(5) \"deum\" like \"equum\" is a genitive masculine plural.]\n[(6) Like in Greek, future tense also has an obligatory meaning: must, ought to, am to.]\n[(7) Here Catullus switches to present tense. I maintained this (?) quirk of His.]\n[(8) \"tuos\" should be \"tuus\", Catullus did that on purpose. Here is used the Greek suffix of the nominative masculine singular. Cf. \"Cybeles\" and \"Cybebes\": here with Greek suffix of the genitive feminine singular.]",
      "Perseus": "THE ADVENTURES OF ATYS\nO'er high deep seas in speedy ship his voyage Atys sped\nUntil he trod the Phrygian grove with hurried eager tread\nAnd as the gloomy tree-shorn stead, the she-god's home, he sought\nThere sorely stung with fiery ire and madman's vaguing thought,\nShare he with sharpened flint the freight wherewith his form was fraught.\nThen as the she-he sensed limbs were void of manly strain\nAnd sighted freshly shed a-ground spot of ensanguined stain,\nSnatched she the timbrel's legier load with hands as snowdrops white,\nThy timbrel, Mother Cybele, the firstings of thy rite,\nAnd as her tender finger-tips on bull-back hollow rang\nShe rose a-grieving and her song to listening comrades sang.\n\"Up Gallae, hie together, haste for Cybele's deep grove,\nHie to the Dindymnean dame, ye flocks that love to rove;\nThe which affecting stranger steads as bound in exile's brunt\nMy sect pursuing led by me have nerved you to confront\nThe raging surge of salty sea and ocean's tyrant hand\nAs your hate of\nVenus\n' hest your manly forms unmann'd,\nGladden your souls, ye mistresses, with sense of error bann'd.\nDrive from your spirits dull delay, together follow ye\nTo hold of Phrygian goddess, home of Phrygian Cybebe,\nWhere  loud the cymbal's voice resounds with timbrel-echoes blending,\nAnd where the Phrygian piper drones grave bass from reed a-bending,\nWhere toss their ivy-circled heads with might the Maenades\nWhere ply mid shrilly lullilooes the holiest mysteries,\nWhere to fly here and there be wont the she-god's vaguing train,\nThither behoves us lead the dance in quick-step hasty strain.\"\nSoon as had Atys (bastard-she) this lay to comrades sung\nThe Chorus sudden lulliloos with quivering, quavering tongue,\nAgain the nimble timbrel groans, the scooped-out cymbals clash,\nAnd up green Ida flits the Choir, with footsteps hurrying rash\nThen Atys frantic, panting, raves, a-wandering, lost, insane,\nAnd leads with timbrel hent and treads the shades where shadows rain,\nLike heifer spurning load of yoke in yet unbroken pride;\nAnd the swift Gallae follow fain their first and fleet-foot guide.\nBut when the home of Cybele they make with toil out-worn\nO'er much, they lay them down to sleep and gifts of\nCeres\nscorn;\nTill heavy slumbers seal their eyelids langourous, drooping lowly,\nAnd raving frenzy flies each brain departing softly, slowly.\nBut when Dan Sol with radiant eyes that fire his face of gold\nSurveyed white aether and solid soil and waters uncontrol'd,\nAnd chased with steeds sonorous-hooved the shades of lingering night,\nThen sleep from waking Atys fled fleeting with sudden flight,\nBy Nymph Pasithae welcomed to palpitating breast.\nThus when his frenzy raging rash was soothed to gentlest rest,\nAtys revolved deeds lately done, as thought from breast unfolding,\nAnd what he'd lost and what he was with lucid sprite beholding,\nTo shallows led by surging soul again the way 'gan take.\nThere casting glance of weeping eyes where vasty billows brake,\nSad-voiced in pitifullest lay his native land bespake.\n\"Country of me, Creatress mine, born to thee and bred,\nBy hapless me abandoned as by thrall from lordling fled,\nWhen me to Ida's groves and glades these vaguing footsteps bore\nTo tarry 'mid the snows and where lurk beasts in antres frore\nAnd seek the deeply hidden lairs where furious ferals meet!\nWhere, Country!

      "PoetryinTranslation": "As soon as Attis , borne over the deep seas in a swift boat,\nhad reached the Phrygian woods, with rapid eager steps,\nhad returned to a dark corner of the goddess’s grove,\ngoaded by mad fury, and there, his wits wandering\nhad sliced off his testicles with a sharp stone,\nand had seen his remaining members devoid of power,\nand that country’s soil spotted with fresh blood,\nhe took up the drum lightly in his pale hands,\nyour drum, Cybele , yours, Great Mother, in your rite,\nand striking the sounding bull’s-hide with delicate fingers,\nchanted to his followers, as it quivered from his assault:\ncome, now, wandering cattle of Dindymus ’s Lady,\nlike exiles wandering here on an alien shore,\nfollowers of my way, lead by me, my friends,\nyou suffered the swift seas and the wild waves\nand sheared your sex from your bodies with great hatred:\ngladden the Lady’s spirit with swift movements.\nBanish dull delay from your minds: come, now, follow,\nto Phrygian Cybele’s house, the Phrygian goddess’s grove,\nwhere the voice of the cymbal clashes, the drum echoes,\nwhere the Phrygian flute-player plays on a curving reed,\nwhere the ivy-crowned Maenads violently toss their heads,\nwhere they act out the sacred rites with high-pitched howls,\nwhere the goddess’s wandering retinue’s wont to hover,\nwhere we should hurry with our swift triple-step.’\nAs Attis, the counterfeit woman, sings this to his friends,\nthe Bacchic choir suddenly cries with quivering tongues,\nthe drum echoes it gently, the hollow cymbals ring.\nThe swift choir comes to green Ida on hurrying feet.\nAttis, leading, panting wildly, goading his scattered wits,\nenters the dark grove accompanied by the drum,\nlike a wild heifer escaping the weight of the yoke:\nThe agile Gallae follow their swift-footed leader.\nThen, since wearied, foodless, they reach Cybele’s grove,\nthey’re seized by sleep from their excessive labours.\nDull tiredness overwhelms eyes giving way to languor:\nmad frenzy vanishes in the calm of gentle breath.\nBut when the Sun from his golden face scanned the bright\nheavens with radiant eye, the harsh earth, and wild sea,\nand dispelled the shadows of night with his lively steeds,\nthen the Grace, Pasithea , takes swift Sleep, flying\nfrom the waking Attis, to her beating heart.\nSo, rapidly, from sweet dream and free of madness,\nAttis recollected his actions in his thoughts,\nand saw with a clear heart what and where he had been,\nturning again with passionate mind to the sea.\nThere gazing at the wide waters with tearful eyes\nhe raised his voice and sadly bemoaned his homeland:\nI, who left you so sadly, have reached the groves of Ida,\nlike a slave fleeing his master, so am I among\nsnows, and the frozen lairs of wild creatures,\nand should I in madness enter one of their dens\nwhere would I think to find you buried in those places?\nThe keen eye itself desires to turn itself towards you,\nwhile my thought is free a while of the wild creatures.\nHave I been brought from my distant home for this grove?\nShall I lose country, possessions, friends, kin?\nShall I lose forum, wrestling ring, stadium and gymnasium?\nSorrow on sorrow, again and again complaint in the heart.\nWhat form have I not been, what have I not performed?\nI a woman, I a young man, a youth, a boy,\nI the flower of the athletes, the glory of the wrestling ring:\nmy doorway frequented, my threshold warm,\nmy house was garlanded with wreaths of flowers,\nat the dawn separation from my bed.\nNow am I brought here priest and slave of divine Cybele?\nI, to be Maenad : a part of myself: a sterile man?\nI to worship on green Ida in a place cloaked in frozen snow?\nI to live my life beneath the high summits of Phrygia,\nwhere deer haunt the woods, where the wild boar roams?\nNow I grieve for what I did, now I repent.’\nAs the swift sounds leave his rosy lips\nthe fresh words reach the twin ears of the goddess,\nas Cybele is loosing the lions from their yoke\nand goading the left-hand beast: she spoke to it,\nsaying: ‘Go now, be fierce, so you make him mad, so he\nis forced to return to the grove by the pain of his madness,\nhe who desires to escape my rule so freely.\nLet your tail wound your back, let the lashes show,\nmake the whole place echo to your bellowing roar,\nshake your red mane fiercely over your taut neck.’\nSo Cybele spoke in threat and loosed the leash.\nThe wild beast urging itself to speed, roused in spirit,\ntore away, roared, broke madly through the thickets.\nand when it reached the wet margin of the white sands,\nand saw delicate Attis near to the ocean waves,\nit charged. He fled demented to the wild wood:\nthere to be ever enslaved, for the rest of his life.\nGoddess, Great Goddess, Cybele, Lady of Dindymus,\nMistress, let all your anger be far from my house:\nmake others aroused, make other men raving mad."

      "Negenborn": "The pine trees erstwhile grown on Mt. Pelion's summit are\nsaid to have floated on Neptune's clear waves to Phasis,\nAeëtean land, when the fittest young men, the glory of\nArgive manpower, dared travel over the sea's briny waters on\na rapidly moving ship as they swept the deep blue expanse\nwith wooden oars, because they hoped to steal the Golden\nFleece from Colchis. Athena Polias, holding fast the\ncitadels on the cities' summits for the Argonauts, made a\nship that moves rapidly with a light gust of wind, joining\npinewood frameworks for a curved keel. The Argo first\ndrenched the virgin sea with its travel; as soon as it\nplowed with its beak the windy sea and the waves, white with\nspume and spun in an eddy by the rowing, the maritime\nNereids raised their faces from the sparkling whirlpool of\nthe sea in admiration of the sight. The men saw by one and\nno other light these mermaids in the nude, stand nipple-naked\nin the grey-green swell. Then Peleus, inflamed,\nis carried away in love with Thetis, then Thetis does not\nscorn human marriage, then her father himself understands\nthat Peleus must be joined to Thetis. O heroes, born in a\ntime much desired by the generations, and kin of the gods,\nyou hail! Good daughter of good mothers, hail again! I'll\naddress you often in my song. And Peleus, are you the top\nman of Thessaly, so especially honored with prosperous\nwedding torches, to whom Jupiter himself, himself the father\nof the gods, gave his mistress? Did Thetis, the lovely\nNereid, embrace you? Did Tethys and Oceanus, who in the sea\nembrace the whole world, grant you their granddaughter to\nmarry? Then on that very same longed for day, all of\nThessaly thronged to come together to the house, and the\npalace was filled with rejoicing crowds: they bore gifts\nbefore themselves and made their delights known by their\ncountenance. They left Cieros; they left Phthiotic Tempe,\nthe houses of Crannon and walls of Larisa; they came\ntogether at Pharsalus and filled Pharsalian houses. As\nnobody lived in the hinterland, the necks of young bulls had\nbecome soft, the low grapevines hadn't been cleared out with\ncurved hoes, no bull was tugging at the earth with a sloping\nplowshare, no foliage tenders' knives pared down the shadow\nof a tree, but rust had been accumulating filth on the\nlonely plows. Yet Peleus' home, wherever the opulent palace\nextended, was shining with gleaming gold and silver. Ivory\nwas shining on the thrones, drinking cups were shining on\nthe table, and the whole house, glittering, rejoiced in the\nroyal treasure. In the middle of the house there had been\nplaced, indeed for a godly bride, a marriage couch gleaming\nwith Indian ivory and covered by porphyry with figures of\nArchaic folk, showing with delicate handiwork the rugged\nvirtue of the heroes. But gazing out from the shore of\nNaxos, which resounds with the noise of the sea, Ariadne\nwatched Theseus' departure by rapid fleet. She has been\nbearing untamed passions in her breast, but even now she\ndoesn't yet believe she sees the things she views; this is\nno wonder, since she, then for the first time roused from\ndeceptive sleep, perceives herself unhappily abandoned on a\nlonely beach. But the heedless young man beats the waters of\nthe sea as he slips off, leaving the empty promises of a\nwindy gale behind. Ariadne with sad eyes looks at him from\nafar, from the rocky seaweed, like a statue of a Maenad.\nAlas! She looks at him from afar in turmoil over torrents of\ncares, and she fails to hold fast the fine textured\nheaddress around her blonde hair; her sheer cloak exposes a\nbreast it no longer veils; and her smooth brassiere no\nlonger keeps her milk white breasts in bondage. The sea's\nwaves were playing with everything that had fallen off\nAriadne's body dispersedly before her feet. But, Theseus,\nwhile she was caring for the plight of neither her headdress\nnor her flowing cloak, she who is doomed has been depending\non you with all her heart, all her spirit, and all her mind.\nO wretched woman, whom Venus has maddened with unremitting\nsorrows by sowing in your heart thorny cares since that time\nwhen Theseus, having left the curvaceous shores of Piraeus,\nboldly touched upon the Cretan palace and grounds of an\nunjust king! They say that Athens, once upon a time\ncompelled by the cruel Plague to pay penalties for the\nkilling of Androgeon, was accustomed to giving the Minotaur\nselect young men as well as the flower of unwed young women\nas a sacrificial meal. When the narrow walls were harried by\ntheir woes, Theseus himself wished to fling forth his body\nfor dear Athens to keep such living corpses of Athens from\nbeing carried to Crete. And so, pressing on in a light boat\nand gentle breezes, he comes to great hearted Minos and his\nproud places. As soon as royal Ariadne caught sight of him\nin a desirous light, the chaste little bed, emitting sweet\nfragrances, nursed her in her mother's soft embrace; the\nfragrances were like the smell of the myrtles that surround\nEurotas' streams, or the various shades of flowers borne by\nthe breeze of spring. No sooner than she had lowered some\ndesirous eyes from Theseus did she catch a flame in her\nwhole body and blaze up completely from the depth of her\nmarrow. Alas! Stirring up passions with a pitiless heart, O\nCupid, you mix people's joys with their cares and bring\ndisastrous results; and you, Venus, who rule lush Idalium,\nwith such tears have you tormented an inflamed young woman's\nmind, for how often she sighs over fair haired Theseus! How\nmany anxieties has she brought my fainting heart! By how\nmuch more than the color of gold did she often blanch when\nTheseus sought either death or the spoils of praise as he\nvowed to fight the Minotaur! Promising gifts not in vain and\nnot unwelcome to the gods, she took up her prayers with\nsealed lips. Just as a tree trunk, agitating violently on\nthe summit of Bull Ridge because of a whirlwind gust,\nuproots an oak tree whose bark leaks sap (it falls, roots\nand all, driven forcibly out and leaning forth a great\ndistance, upon far and wide breaking everything in its\npath), so Theseus, subdued in body, lay low the beast, who\nthrew up his horns in vain at the empty winds. From that\npoint, with much praise, Theseus safely bent back his foot\nas he directed his wandering footsteps with a thin string,\nlest an undetectable mistake baffle him as he exits the\ntortuous turnings of the house. Having digressed from the\nfirst poem, what more shall I recall: how a daughter,\nleaving behind the countenance of her father, the embrace of\nher sister Phaedra, and finally the embrace of her mother\nPasiphaë, who loved her ill fated daughter to distraction,\nchose Theseus' sweet love over all these things; or how,\nconveyed by boat, she came to the frothy shores of Nexos; or\nhow her husband Theseus with heedless heart left her behind,\nher eyes bound in sleep as he departed? They often say that\nshe, raving from a blazing heart, had uttered shrill oaths\nfrom the bottom of her breast, and then that the unhappy\nwoman climbed steep mountains from which to extend her gaze\ninto the desolate swell of the sea, and then that she rolled\nforth into the waves of the splashing sea that faced her as\nshe raised the voluptuous coverings from her denuded calf,\nand that she had said these unhappy words, her final\nlamentation: \"Treacherous, treacherous Theseus! Is this the\nway you abandon me, who was carried off from patriarchal\naltars, onto the lonely shore? Feckless man, have you run\naway because you thought the gods' heavenly powers\ninconsequential? Are you coming home to bear unholy\nperjuries? Could nothing divert the deliberations of a cruel\nmind? Did you have no mercy available for your implacable\nheart to wish me tenderness? Yet you did not formerly give\nme these assurances with a sweet voice, and you were not\nbidding me, who was unhappy, to anticipate these things, but\nthe airy winds tear to pieces a desired marriage and a happy\nwedding, the whole of which is null and void. Even now, may\nno woman put faith in a man who swears by oath, and may no\nwoman trust that a man's discourses are worthy of trust;\nwhile the mind of men, when it desires, is especially eager\nto obtain something, the men are by no means loath to swear\nby oath and by no means refrain from promises: but as soon\nas the desirous mind's lust has been satisfied, by no means\ndo men fear what has been said, and by no means do they care\nabout their breaches of oath! Certainly I snatched you away\nas you were tossing and turning in the middle of death's\nmaelstrom, and I decided to lose a brother rather than fail\nyou at a critical and treacherous time. For the which I\nshall be given as prey to be torn piecemeal by birds and\nbeasts, and when I have died, I shall not be covered with a\nburial mound! What lioness gave birth to you from her lonely\ncrag? What sea, conceived by foaming waves, has spit you\nout? What Syrtis, what predatory Scylla, what endless\nCharybdis gave you birth, you who return such rewards for\nliving sweet? Though I have known since you shuddered at the\nstern orders of your old fashioned parents that you had been\nscorning our wedding all along, you nevertheless were able\nto bring me home to wait on you in delightful labor as your\nservant, refreshing your pale feet with clear water and\ncovering your bed with the purple bedspread. Furthermore,\nright about now Theseus is tossing and turning amid the\nwaves, and no human form appears among the vast seaweed.\nThus, cruelly mocking me this final time, even stern Fortune\nhas been begrudging of her ear to my complaints. Almighty\nJupiter, I wish that the sterns of ships had never touched\nthe Cretan and Athenian shores and that the treacherous\nsailor who bears into Crete his gruesome payments to a wild\nbull had not untied the hawser of his ship, and that this\nmalicious guest, hiding cruel purposes with sweet\ncomportment, had not found rest in my home! Where shall I\nreturn? For what hope shall I, who am lost, ever strive?\nShall I seek Mt. Ida? No, because as it makes a separation\nwith a broad, swirling mass of water, it divides the\nferocious sea from the bridge. Can it be that I was supposed\nto hope for my father's help? Which young man have I let\nsplatter on my brother's murder? Is it that I am supposed to\ntake comfort in my husband's devoted love for me? Who is it\ntaking flight, bending pliant oars into the sea? Moreover,\nno house inhabits the lonely island, and no exit from the\nsea lies open, thanks to the surrounding waves. There is no\nescape, and no hope for one: everything has changed,\neverything has been deserted, and everything exhibits death;\nnevertheless, my eyes will not grow feeble with death, and\nmy senses will not withdraw from my exhausted body, until I,\nwho've been abandoned, demand a stiff penalty from the gods\nand invoke the trust of the gods in my final hour.\nWherefore, you Furies, who penalize the deeds of men with\navenging punishment, and whose foreheads, wreathed in\nserpentine hair, display the breathing ire of your hearts,\napproach, approach to this place, and hear my complaints,\nwhich - alas! - I, miserable and powerless, must speak from\ndeep inside myself as I burn, blind with demented rage!\nSince these complaints are truly borne from the bottom of my\nheart, do not let my lamentation be ineffectual, but pollute\nTheseus and his kinsmen with the state of mind wherein he\nleft me when he abandoned me, ye Goddesses!\" After she\npoured these words forth from her unhappy heart, eagerly\ndemanding reparations for savage deeds, the gods' ruler,\nwith unvanquished power, consented, wherefore the earth and\nthe wild seas violently trembled, and the heavens shook the\ntwinkling stars. Furthermore, his mind beset by blinding\ndarkness, Theseus, himself absent of mind, transgressed\nevery command he'd resolutely honored hitherto, and had\nforgotten to gladden his worried father when he failed to\nshow that his voyage to the Piraeus had been safe. They say\nthat when to the winds Aegeus entrusted his son, who, upon\nshowing esteem for the walls of Athens, was leaving them by\nfleet, he had given the young man orders of this ilk: \"My\nonly son, more delightful to me than long life, my son, whom\nI'm compelled to lower to perilous plights, returned to me\nat the dusk of my age, since my fortune and your passionate\ncourage snatch you away from me against my wishes, I whose\neyes, weak with old age, have not yet been sated by the dear\naspect of my son, neither rejoicing with happy heart shall I\nlet you go, nor shall I allow you to accept the signs of\nfavorable fortune, but that first I shall express the many\nlaments in my mind as I foul my gray hair with dirt and sand\npoured thereon, and therefrom I'll suspend dyed sails from a\nroaming mast, that a Spanish sail, darkened to rust, shall\nbespeak my sorrows and agonies of mind. But if Athena of\nsacred Itonus, who has agreed to defend our family and the\nseats of Erectheus, has granted that you spatter your right\nhand with the blood of a bull, then bring it about that\nthese orders shall flourish in your mindful heart, and that\nno generation shall cause them to be forgotten; that as soon\nas your eyes look upon our hills, the yardarms from all\ndirections shall put away the black dyed sail, and the\ntwisted ropes shall raise the white sails; and that,\ndistinguishing them as soon as possible, I shall recognize\nglory with a happy mind when the happy day presents you once\nagain to me.\" These orders, earlier held in his resolute\nmind, left Theseus as clouds, pushed by a gust of the winds,\nabandon the airy tip of a snowy mountain. But his father, as\nhe sought a view from the top of the citadel and wasted away\nhis anxious eyes in unremitting sobs, and as soon as he\ncaught sight of the cloth of the dyed sails, threw himself\nheadfirst from the summit of the projecting rocks because he\nbelieved that Theseus had succumbed to a violent end. Then\nshe, afflicted and sad, caused varied concerns to roll in\nher mind by gazing out at the ship as it left. But from\nanother part of the quilt, Bacchus, in the glory of his\nyouth, has been flying about, along with his troupe of\nSatyrs and his attendants from Mt. Nysa, looking for you,\nAriadne, and inflamed by your love. The Maenads have raved\nfor Bacchus dispersedly, with frenzied mind, euhoe! The\nMaenads, euhoe, are throwing back their heads! Some of them\nwere shaking spears with a covered tip, some were tossing\nabout the limbs of a bullock which had been torn apart, some\nwere wrapping themselves with twisted serpents, and some\nwere honoring esoteric icons with hollow wicker boxes, icons\nabout which the uninitiated long in vain to hear; others\nwere beating tomtoms with long palms or producing tinny,\nclangorous sounds with polished bronze; for many, horns\nblasted harsh sounding, booming bass sounds; and an\noutlandish pipe made a strident shriek and played a dreadful\nsong. The bedspread, splendidly decorated with such figures,\nhaving clasped the bed, was covering it with its vesture.\nAfter the Thessalian men have been satisfied with looking\neagerly at these scenes, they begin to make way for the\ninviolate gods. Then, as the West Wind, ruf fling the placid\nsea with its morning breath, sends the waves tumbling forth\nas the goddess of Dawn rises up under the threshold of the\nrising sun; the waves, at first brushed back by a gentle\nbreeze, move forward and liltingly sound with the gentle\nbeat of laughter; and afterwards, with a growing wind, they\nintensify more and more; and, as they float, they gleam to a\ngreat distance from the rosy light; so then, with roaming\nfoot, each person leaving the forecourt's royal chambers\nscattered for home. After the guests' departure, Chiron\nfirst of all came from the top of Mt. Peleus, bearing gifts\nof the forest: for whatever flowers the fields bear,\nwhatever flowers the region of Thessaly, with great\nmountains, produces, whatever flowers the fertile breeze of\na warm zephyr by the river waves supplies, he himself bore\nthem, plaited with an assortment of small wreaths, and the\nhouse laughed, having been refreshed by their delightful\nfragrance. Not empty handed, Penios is immediately present,\nleaving the green Tempe valley, which everywhere the woods\nsurround from above, to be filled with Doric dancers as if\nat the touch of Minos: for he has brought, roots and all,\ntall beech trees and lofty laurels with straight trunks, a\nwaving plane tree, a supple poplar (the sister of Phaëthon,\nwho burns), and a towering cypress. He placed these things,\narranged far and wide around the palace of Peleus, that the\ncovered forecourt might be verdant with voluptuous foliage.\nBehind him, Prometheus follows, ingenious of heart,\ninconspicuously bearing the scars of an ancient debt, paid\nwith his limbs tied back to a rock as he hung from the steep\nsummits. Then, the father of the gods, along with his sacred\nwife and his children, came through the sky, leaving you lonely,\nApollo, and leaving your twin sister, who is at the same\ntime the local goddess of the mountains of Idrus: for along\nwith you, your sister has likewise spurned Peleus and not\nwished to celebrate the wedding of Thetis. Jupiter and Juno\nsat on ivory chairs, and the tables were piled high with\nvarious food, when the Moirai began to yield truth telling\nsongs as they shook their bodies with a feeble motion in the\nmeantime. White robes with purple hems wrapped the Moirai's\nankles and hugged their gyrating bodies throughout, but red\nheadbands remained fastened to their white hair, and their\nhands duly pressed on with their everlasting toil. Her left\nhand held a distaff wrapped in soft wool, and then her right\nhand, lightly bringing down the threads, would shape a\nmantle as her fingers faced upward; then, with her thumb\nfacing the ground, she would turn her spindle, which is\nweighted with a round weight. Then her tooth would always\neven up the thread as she nibbled; to her dry lips there\nwould cling woolly morsels, which had earlier been strands\nstanding out from smooth thread. Also, before her feet,\nsmall wicker baskets contained the soft fleece of white\nwool. Then the Moirai, beating the fleece with a clear\nsounding voice, uttered the following prophecies by divine\nincantation, a song which no age of treachery will\nthereafter prove wrong: You, Peleus, who increase the best\nof the best with great examples of virtue, O guardian of\nEmathia, most dear to Jupiter, hear what your sisters reveal\nto you by the happy light of day, a truth telling oracle:\nbut you, the weighted spindles, follow these crossthreads as\nprophecies; run, run as you lead them! To you, Peleus, the\nevening star will come now, bringing things desired by\nhusbands; your bride, under a lucky star, will come to\nsuffuse your mind with persuasive love, ready to join with\nyou into languid little dreams as she offers her smooth arms\nto your strong neck. You weighted spindles, run, run as you\nweave the crossthreads of life! No house has ever sheltered\nsuch lovers, no love has ever joined lovers with such a bond\nas the harmony present for Thetis, the harmony present for\nPeleus. You weighted spindles, run, run as you weave the\ncrossthreads of life! To the two of you Achilles will be\nborn immune to extreme fear, known by enemies not for his\nback but for his stalwart chest. Quite often the winner in\nthe far ranging contest of running, he will outrun the fiery\nswift tracks of a swift moving doe. You weighted spindles,\nrun, run as you weave the crossthreads of life! No hero will\ncompare to him in war when the Phrygian fields flow with\nTeucrian blood, and as he besieges the Trojan town walls\nduring a war prolonged, the third heir of oath breaking\nPelops will lay them to waste. You weighted spindles, run,\nrun as you weave the crossthreads of life! At the funeral\nrites of sons who opposed Achilles in battle, mothers will\noften confess his outstanding virtues and famous feats as\nthey tear unkempt hair from their gray heads and bruise\ntheir wizened breasts with their feeble palms. You weighted\nspindles, run, run as you weave the crossthreads of life!\nFor just as a reaper, gathering closely packed ears of grain\nbefore their time, mows the yellow fields under the burning\nsun, Achilles will smite the bodies of Trojan men with his\nhostile iron sword. You weighted spindles, run, run as you\nweave the crossthreads of life! Spread out dispersedly from\nthe fast flowing Dardanelles, the Scamander River will\nwitness many examples of virtue; Achilles, narrowing the\nDardanelles' path with piles of bodies hewn, will warm the\ndeep rivers with gore indiscriminate. You weighted spindles,\nrun, run as you weave the crossthreads of life! Then Priam's\ndaughter as well will witness death when a rounded funeral\npyre, piled up in a lofty mound of rubble, will receive the\nsnowy limbs of the young girl smitten. You weighted\nspindles, run, run as you weave the crossthreads of life! As\nsoon as Fortune gives the exhausted Greeks an opportunity to\ndislodge Troy's surrounding walls, which Neptune built, the\ndeep tombs will become wet with the blood of Polyxena, who,\njust as she submits as living sacrificial victim to the\nJanus faced axe, already a corpse will fling her trunk onto\nher bent knee. You weighted spindles, run, run as you weave\nthe crossthreads of life! Therefore, join together in\nheartfelt love. May Peleus receive Thetis in happy bonding,\nand now, after all this time, may the wife be delivered to\nher eager husband! You weighted spindles, run, run as you\nweave the crossthreads of life! Thetis' nurse, returning at\ndawn, will be unable to fit the thread of yesterday around\nthe neck of Thetis, and the anxious mother of a quarrelsome\ndaughter will not sadly cease to hope for dear descendants\nbecause her daughter sleeps apart from Peleus. You weighted\nspindles, run, run as you weave the crossthreads of life!\nSinging by way of preface such erstwhile happy songs of\nPeleus, the Moirai sang with divine soul. For when\nrighteousness was not yet spurned, heaven's inhabitants used\nto go to see the heroes' houses, free from wrong, and reveal\nthemselves in the guise of a mortal throng. The father of\nthe gods, paying his regular visit to the gleaming temple,\ncaught sight of one hundred bulls falling forward onto the\nground, since the yearly rites had come on the festal days.\nOften, Dionysus, rambling on the utmost summit of Parnasus,\nconducted the Maenads, with disheveled hair, shouting,\n\"Euhoe,\" since the people of Delphi, rushing from all over\nthe city and eagerly vying with one another, happily\nreceived the god as the altars issued smoke. Often, Mars, in\na death bearing contest of battle, or Athena, mistress of\nthe swift Triton River, or Artemis urged armed squadrons on\nin person. But after the earth was given its first\nexperience of unspeakable crime, and everyone expelled\njustice from his greedy mind, brothers drenched their hands\nin brotherly blood, the son ceased to mourn his deceased\nparents, the father wished for the funeral of his youthful\nson that he might freely enjoy the youthful beauty of his\nunwed stepmother, and the mother, blasphemously offering her\nson her sex, did not fear defiling the household gods with\nsinful acts. All things, lawful or not, blended thoroughly\nwith malicious passion, diverted from us the just mind of\nthe gods. The gods therefore will neither visit our weddings\nnor be illuminated by the bright light of day.\nTaken with kind permission from Brendan",
      "Perseus": "Marriage of Peleus and Thetis\nPine-trees gendered whilome upon soaring Peliac summit\nSwam (as the tale is told) through liquid surges of\nNeptune\nFar as the Phasis-flood and frontier-land Aeetean;\nWhenas the youths elect, of\nArgive\nvigour the oak-heart,\nLonging the Golden Fleece of the Colchis-region to harry,\nDared in a poop swift-paced to span salt seas and their shallows,\nSweeping the deep blue seas with sweeps a-carven of fir-wood.\nShe, that governing Goddess of citadels crowning the cities,\nBuilded herself their car fast-flitting with lightest of breezes,\nWeaving plants of the pine conjoined in curve of the kelson;\nForemost of all to imbue rude Amphitrite with ship-lore.\nSoon as her beak had burst through wind-rackt spaces of ocean,\nWhile the oar-tortured wave with spumy whiteness was blanching,\nSurged from the deep abyss and hoar-capped billows the faces\nSeaborn, Nereids eyeing the  prodigy wonder-smitten.\nThere too mortal orbs through softened spendours regarded\nOcean-nymphs who exposed bodies denuded of raiment\nBare to the breast upthrust from hoar froth capping the sea-depths.\nThen Thetis Peleus fired (men say) a-sudden with love,\nThen Thetis nowise spurned to mate and marry with mortal,\nThen Thetis' Sire himself her yoke with Peleus sanctioned.\nOh, in those happier days now fondly yearned-for, you heroes\nBorn; (all hail!) of the gods begotten, and excellent issue\nBred by your mothers, all hail! and placid deal me your favour.\nOft with the sound of me, in strains and spells I'll invoke you;\nYou too by wedding-torch so happily, highly augmented,\nPeleus,\nThessaly\n's ward, in whose favor\nJupiter\nhimself,\nThe Father of the gods, resigned his passions.\nYou Thetis, fairest of maids Nereian, vouchsafed to marry?\nYou did Tethys empower to woo and wed with her grandchild;\nNor less Oceanus, with water compassing th' Earth-globe?\nBut when ended the term, and wisht-for light of the day-tide\nUprose, flocks to the house in concourse mighty, convened,\nThessaly\nall, with glad assembly the Palace fulfilling:\nPresents afore they bring, and joy in faces declare they.\nCieros abides a desert: they quit Phthiotican Tempe,\nHomesteads of Crannon-town, eke bulwarkt walls Larissa;\nMeeting at\nPharsalus\n, and roof Pharsalian seeking.\nNone will the fields now till; soft wax all necks the oxen,\nNever the humble vine is purged by curve of the rake-tooth,\nNever a pruner's hook thins out the shade of the tree-tufts,\nNever a bull up-plows broad glebe with bend of the coulter,\nOver whose point unuse displays the squalor of rust-stain.\nBut in the homestead's heart, where'er that opulent palace\nHides a retreat, all shines with splendour of gold and of silver.\nIvory blanches the seats, bright gleam the flagons a-table,\nAll of the mansion joys in royal riches and grandeur.\nBut for the Diva's use bestrewn is the genial bedstead,\nHidden in midmost stead, and its polisht framework of Indian\nTusk underlies its cloth empurpled by juice of the dye-shell.\nThis be a figured cloth with forms of manhood primeval\nShowing by marvel-art the gifts and graces of heroes.\nHere upon Dia's strand wave-resonant, ever-regarding\nTheseus borne from sight outside by fleet of the fleetest,\nStands Ariadne with heart full-filled with furies unbated,\nNor can her sense as yet believe she 'spies the espied,\nWhen like one that awakes new roused from slumber deceptive,\nSees she her hapless self lone left on loneliest sandbank:\nWhile as the mindless youth with oars disturbeth the shallows,\nCasts to the windy storms what vows he vainly had vowed.\nHim through the sedges afar the sad-eyed maiden of Minos,\nLikest a Bacchant-girl stone-carven, (O her sorrow!)\n'Spies, a-tossing the while on sorest billows of love-care.\nNow no more on her blood-hued hair fine fillets retains she,\nNo more now light veil conceals her bosom erst hidden,\nNow no more smooth zone contains her milky-hued paplets:\nAll gear dropping adown from every part of her person\nThrown, lie fronting her feet to the briny wavelets a sea-toy.\nBut at such now no more of her veil or her fillet a-floating\nHad she regard: on you, Theseus! all of her heart-strength,\nAll of her sprite, her mind, forlorn, were evermore hanging.\nAh, sad soul, by grief and grievance driven beside you,\nSowed Erycina first those brambly cares in thy bosom,\nWhat while issuing fierce with will enstarkened, Theseus\nForth from the  bow-bent shore Piraean putting a-seawards\nReacht the Gortynian roofs where dwelt the injurious Monarch.\nFor 'twas told of yore how forced by pestilence cruel,\nEke as a blood rite due for the Androgeonian murder,\nMany a chosen youth and the bloom of damsels unmarried\nFood for the Minotaur, Cecropia was wont to befurnish.\nSeeing his narrow walls in such wise vexed with evils,\nTheseus of freest will for dear-loved\nAthens\nhis body\nOffered a victim so that no more to\nCrete\nbe deported\nLives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;\nThen with a swifty ship and soft breathed breezes a-stirring,\nSought he Minos the Haughty where homed in proudest of Mansions.\nHim as with yearning glance forthright espied the royal\nMaiden, whom pure chaste couch aspiring delicate odours\nCherisht, in soft embrace of a mother comforted all-whiles,\n(E'en as the myrtles begot by the flowing floods of Eurotas,\nOr as the tincts distinct brought forth by breath of the springtide)\nNever the burning lights of her eyes from gazing upon him\nTurned she, before fierce flame in all her body conceived she\nDown in its deepest depths and burning within her marrow.\nAh, with unmitigate heart exciting wretchedmost furies,\nYou, Boy sacrosanct! man's grief and gladness commingling,\nYou too of Golgos Queen and Lady of leafy\nIdalium\n,\nWhelm'd you in what manner waves that maiden fantasy-fired,\nAll for a blond-haired youth suspiring many a singulf!\nWhiles how dire was the dread she dreed in languishing heart-strings;\nHow yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she paled!\nWhenas yearning to mate his might with the furious monster\nTheseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.\nThen of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,\nPromise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.\nFor as an oak that shakes on topmost summit of Taurus\nIts boughs, or cone-growing pine from bole bark resin exuding,\nWhirlwind of passing might that twists the stems with its storm-blasts,\nUproots, deracinates, forthright its trunk to the farthest,\nProne falls, shattering wide what lies in line of its downfall,—\nThus was that wildling flung by Theseus and vanquisht of body,\nVainly tossing its horns and goring the wind to no purpose.\nThence with abounding praise returned he, guiding his footsteps,\nWhile a fine drawn thread checked steps in wander abounding,\nLest when issuing forth of the winding maze labyrinthine\nBaffled become his track by inobservable error.\nBut for what cause should I, from early subject digressing,\nTell of the daughter who the face of her sire unseeing,\nEke her sister's embrace nor less her mother's endearments,\nWho in despair bewept her hapless child that so gladly\nChose before every and each the lively wooing of Theseus?\nOr how borne by the ship to the yeasting shore-line of Dia\nCame she? or how when bound her eyes in bondage of slumber\nLeft her that chosen mate with mind unmindful departing?\nOften (they tell) with heart inflamed by fiery fury\nPoured she shrilling of shrieks from deepest depths of her bosom;\nNow she would sadly scale the broken faces of mountains,\nWhence she might overglance the boundless boiling of billows,\nThen she would  rush to bestem the salt-plain's quivering wavelet\nAnd from her ankles bare the dainty garment uplifting,\nSpoke she these words ('tis said) from sorrow's deepest abysses,\nWhile from her tear-drencht face outburst cold shivering sobs.\n\"Thus from my patrial shore, O traitor, hurried to exile,\nMe on a lonely strand hast left, perfidious Theseus?\nThus wise farest, despite the godhead of Deities spurned,\n(Reckless, alas!) to your home convoying perjury-curses?\nNaught, then, ever availed that mind of cruelest counsel\nAlter? No saving grace in you was evermore ready,\nThat to have pity on me vouchsafed your pitiless bosom?\nNevertheless not in past time such were the promises wordy\nLavished; nor such hopes to me the hapless were bidden;\nBut the glad married joys, the longed-for pleasures of wedlock.\nAll now empty and vain, by breath of the breezes bescattered!\nNow, let woman no more trust her to man when he sweareth,\nNe'er let her hope to find or truth or faith in his pleadings,\nWho when lustful thought forelooks to somewhat attaining,\nNever an oath they fear, shall spare no promise to promise.\nYet no sooner they sate all lewdness and lecherous fancy,\nNothing remember of words and reck they naught of fore-swearing.\nCertes, you did I snatch from midmost whirlpool of ruin\nDeadly, and held it cheap loss of a brother to suffer\nRather than fail your need (O false!) at hour the supremest.\nTherefore my limbs are doomed to be torn of birds, and of ferals\nPrey, nor shall upheapt Earth afford a grave to my body.\nSay me, what lioness bare you 'neath lone rock of the desert?\nWhat sea spued you conceived from out the spume of his surges!\nWhat manner Syrt, what ravening Scylla, what vasty Charybdis?\nyou who for sweet life saved such meeds are lief of returning!\nIf never willed your breast with me to mate you in marriage,\nHating the savage law decreed by primitive parent,\nStill of your competence 'twas within your household to home me,\nWhere I might serve as slave in gladsome service familiar,\nLaving your snow-white feet in clearest chrystalline waters\nOr with its purpling gear your couch in company strewing.\nYet for what cause should I complain in vain to the winds that unknow me,\n(I so beside me with grief!) which ne'er of senses endued\nHear not the words sent forth nor aught avail they to answer?\nNow be his course well-nigh engaged in midway of ocean,\nNor any mortal shape appears in barrens of sea-wrack.\nThus at the latest hour with insults over-sufficient\nE'en to my plaints fere Fate begrudges ears that would hear me.\nJupiter\n! Lord of All-might, Oh would in days that are bygone\nNe'er had Cecropian poops toucht ground at Gnossian foreshore,\nNor to the unconquered Bull that tribute direful conveying\nHad the false Seaman bound to Cretan island his hawser,\nNor had yon evil wight, 'neath shape the softest hard purpose\nHiding, enjoyed repose within our mansion beguested!\nWhither can wend I now? What hope lends help to the lost one?\nIdomenean mounts shall I scale? Ah, parted by whirlpools\nWidest, yon truculent main where yields it power of passage?\nAid of my sire can I crave? Whom I willing abandoned,\nTreading in tracks of a youth bewrayed with blood of a brother!\nCan I console my soul with the helpful love of a helpmate\nWho flies me with pliant oars, flies overbounding the sea-depths?\nNay, if this Coast I quit, this lone isle lends me no roof-tree,\nNor aught issue allows begirt by billows of Ocean:\nNowhere is path for flight: none hope shows: all things are silent:\nAll be a desolate waste: all makes display of destruction.\nYet never close these eyes in latest languor of dying,\nNe'er from my wearied frame go forth slow-ebbing my senses,\nEre from the Gods just doom implore I, treason-betrayed,\nAnd with my breath supreme firm faith of Celestials invoke I.\nTherefore, O you who 'venge man's deed with penalties direful,\nEumenides! aye wont to bind with viperous hairlocks\nForeheads,—Oh, deign outspeak fierce wrath from bosom outbreathing,\nHither, Oh hither, speed, and lend you all ear to my grievance,\nWhich now sad I (alas!) outpour from innermost vitals\nMaugre my will, sans help, blind, fired with furious madness.\nAnd, as indeed all spring from veriest core of my bosom,\nSuffer you not the cause of grief and woe to evanish;\nBut with the Will wherewith could Theseus leave me in loneness,\nGoddesses! bid that Will lead him, lead his, to destruction.\"\nE'en as she thus poured forth these words from anguish of bosom,\nAnd for this cruel deed, distracted, sued she for vengeance,\nNodded the Ruler of Gods Celestial, matchless of All-might,\nWhen at the gest earth-plain and horrid spaces of ocean\nTrembled, and every sphere rockt stars and planets resplendent.\nMeanwhile Theseus himself, obscured in blindness of darkness\nAs to his mind, dismiss'd from breast oblivious all things\nErewhile enjoined and held hereto in memory constant,\nNor for his saddened sire the gladness-signals uphoisting\nHeralded safe return within sight of the Erechthean harbour.\nFor 'twas told of yore, when from walls of the Virginal Deess\nAegeus speeding his son, to the care of breezes committed,\nThus with a last embrace to the youth spoke words of commandment:\n\"Son! far nearer my heart (you alone) than life of the longest,\nSon, I perforce dismiss to doubtful, dangerous chances,\nLately restored to me when eld draws nearest his ending,\nSince such fortune in me, and in you such boiling of valour\nTear you away from me so loath, whose eyes in their languor\nNever are sated with sight of my son, all-dearest of figures.\nNor will I send you forth with joy that gladdens my bosom,\nNor will I suffer you show boon signs of favouring Fortune,\nBut from my soul I'll first express an issue of sorrow,\nSoiling my hoary hairs with dust and ashes commingled;\nThen will I hang stained sails fast-made to the wavering yard-arms,\nSo shall our mourning thought and burning torture of spirit\nShow by the dark sombre-dye of Iberian canvas spread.\nBut, grant me the grace Who dwells in Sacred Itone,\n(And our issue to guard and ward the seats of Erechtheus\nSware She) that if your right is besprent with blood of the Man-Bull,\nThen do you so-wise act, and stored in memory's heart-core\nDwell these mandates of me, no time their traces untracing.\nDip, when first shall arise our hills to gladden your eye-glance,\nDown from your every mast the ill-omened vestments of mourning,\nThen let the twisten ropes upheave the whitest of canvas,\nWherewith splendid shall gleam the tallest spars of the top-mast,\nThese seeing sans delay with joy exalting my spirit\nWell shall I wot boon Time sets you returning before me.\"\nSuch were the mandates which stored at first in memory constant\nFaded from Theseus' mind like mists, compelled by the whirlwind,\nFleet from aerial crests of mountains hoary with snow-drifts.\nBut as the sire had sought the citadel's summit for outlook,\nWasting his anxious eyes with tear-floods evermore flowing,\nForthright e'en as he saw the sail-gear darkened with dye-stain,\nHeadlong himself flung he from the sea-cliff's pinnacled summit\nHolding his Theseus lost by doom of pitiless Fortune.\nThus as he came to the home funest, his roof-tree paternal,\nTheseus (vaunting the death), what dule to the maiden of Minos\nDealt with unminding mind so dree'd he similar dolour.\nShe too gazing in grief at the kelson vanishing slowly,\nSelf-wrapt, manifold cares revolved in spirit perturbed.\nON ANOTHER PART OF THE COVERLET\nBut from the further side came flitting bright-faced Iacchus\nGirded by Satyr-crew and Nysa-reared Sileni\nBurning with love unto thee (Ariadne!) and greeting thy presence.\n...\nWho flocking eager to fray did rave with infuriate spirit,\n\"Evoe\" frenzying loud, with heads at \"Evoe” rolling.\nBrandisht some of the maids their thyrsi sheathed of spear-point,\nSome snatcht limbs and joints of sturlings rended to pieces,\nThese girt necks and waists with writhing bodies of vipers,\nThose with the gear enwombed in crates dark orgies ordained—\nOrgies that ears profane must vainly lust for o'er hearing—\nOthers with palms on high smote hurried strokes on the cymbal,\nOr from the polisht brass woke thin-toned tinkling music,\nWhile from the many there boomed and blared hoarse blast of the horn-trump,\nAnd with its horrid skirl loud shrilled the barbarous bag-pipe\nShowing such varied forms, that richly-decorated couch-cloth\nFolded in strait embrace the bedding drapery-veiled.\nThis when the Thessalan youths had eyed with eager inspection\nFulfilled, place they began to provide for venerate Godheads,\nEven as Zephyrus' breath, seas couching placid at dawn-tide,\nRoughens, then stings and spurs the wavelets slantingly fretted—\nRising Aurora the while 'neath Sol the wanderer's threshold—\nTardy at first they flow by the clement breathing of breezes\nUrged, and echo the shores with soft-toned ripples of laughter,\nBut as the winds wax high so waves wax higher and higher,\nFlashing and floating afar to outswim morn's purpurine splendours,—\nSo did the crowd fare forth, the royal vestibule leaving,\nAnd to their house each wight with vaguing paces departed.\nAfter their wending, the first, foremost from\nPelion\n's summit,\nChiron came to the front with woodland presents surcharged:\nWhatso of blooms and flowers bring forth Thessalian uplands\nMighty with mountain crests, whate'er of riverine lea flowers\nReareth Favonius' air, bud-breeding, tepidly breathing,\nAll in his hands brought he, unseparate in woven garlands,\nWhereat laughed the house as soothed by pleasure of perfume.\nPresently Péneus appears, deserting verdurous\nTempe\n—\nTempe\ngirt by her belts of greenwood ever impending,\nLeft for the Mamonides with frequent dances to worship—\nNor is he empty of hand, for bears he tallest of beeches\nDeracinate, and bays with straight boles lofty and stately,\nNot without nodding plane-tree nor less the flexible sister\nFire-slain Phaëton left, and not without cypresses airy.\nThese in a line wide-broke set he, the Mansion surrounding,\nSo by the soft leaves screened, the porch might flourish in verdure.\nFollows hard on his track with active spirit Prometheus,\nBearing extenuate sign of penalties suffer'd in by-gones.\nPaid erewhiles what time fast-bound as to every member,\nHung he in carkanet slung from the Scythian rocktor.\nLast did the Father of Gods with his sacred spouse and his offspring,\nProud from the Heavens proceed, thee leaving (Phoebus) in loneness,\nLone wi' thy sister twin who haunteth mountains of Idrus:\nFor that the Virgin spurned as thou the person of Peleus,\nNor Thetis' nuptial torch would greet by act of her presence.\nWhen they had leaned their limbs upon snowy benches reposing,\nTables largely arranged with various viands were garnisht.\nBut, ere opened the feast, with infirm gesture their semblance\nShaking, the Parcae fell to chaunting veridique verses.\nRobed were their tremulous frames all o'er in muffle of garments\nBright-white, purple of hem enfolding heels in its edges;\nSnowy the fillets that bound heads aged by many a year-tide,\nAnd, as their wont aye was, their hands plied labour unceasing.\nEach in her left upheld with soft fleece clothed a distaff,\nThen did the right that drew forth thread with upturn of fingers\nGently fashion the yarn which deftly twisted by thumb-ball\nSpeeded the spindle poised by thread-whorl perfect of polish;\nThus as the work was wrought, the lengths were trimmed wi' the fore-teeth,\nWhile to their thin, dry lips stuck wool-flecks severed by biting,\nWhich at the first outstood from yarn-hanks evenly fine-drawn.\nStill at their feet in front soft fleece-flecks white as the snow-flake\nLay in the trusty guard of wickers woven in withies.\nAlways a-carding the wool, with clear-toned voices resounding\nTold they such lots as these in song divinely directed,\nChaunts which none after-time shall 'stablish falsehood-convicted.\n1.\nO who by virtues great all highmost  honours enhancest,\nGuard of Emáthia-land, most famous made by thine offspring,\nTake what the Sisters deign this gladsome day to

bridegrooms,\nHesperus\n: soon shall come thy spouse with planet auspicious,\nWho shall thy mind enbathe with a love that softens the spirit,\nAnd as thyself shall prepare for sinking in languorous slumber,\nUnder thy neck robust, soft arms dispreading as pillow.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n3.\nNever a house like this such loves as these hath united,\nNever

come Achilles guiltless of fear-sense,\nKnown by his forceful breast and ne'er by back to the foeman,\nWho shall at times full oft in doubtful contest of race-course\nConquer the fleet-foot doe with slot-tracks smoking and burning.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n5.\nNone shall with him compare, howe'er war-doughty a hero,\nWhenas the Phrygian rills flow deep with bloodshed of Teucer,\nAnd beleaguering the walls of\nTroy\nwith longest of warfare\nHe shall the works lay low, third heir of Pelops the perjured.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n6.\nHis be the derring-do and deeds of valour egregious,\nOften mothers shall own at funeral-rites of their children,\nWhat time their hoary hairs from head in ashes are loosened,\nAnd wi' their hands infirm thay smite their bosoms loose duggèd.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n7.\nFor as the toiling hind bestrewing denseness of corn-stalks\nUnder the broiling sun mows grain-fields yellow to harvest,\nSo shall his baneful brand strew earth with corpses of Troy-born.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n8.\nAye to his valorous worth attest shall wave of Scamander\nWhich unto Hellè-Sea fast flowing ever dischargeth,\nStraiter whose course shall grow by up-heaped barrage of corpses,\nWhile in his depths runs warm his stream with slaughter commingled.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n9.\nWitness in fine shall be the victim rendered to death-stroke,\nWhenas the earthern tomb on lofty tumulus builded\nShall of the stricken maid receive limbs white as the snow-flake.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n10.\nFor when at last shall Fors to weary Achaians her fiat\nDeal, of Dardanus-town to burst Neptunian fetters,\nThen shall the high-reared tomb stand bathed with Polyxena's life-blood,\nWho, as the victim doomed to fall by the double-edged falchion,\nForward wi' hams relaxt shall smite a body beheaded.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n11.\nWherefore arise, ye pair, conjoin loves ardently longed-for,\nNow doth the groom receive with happiest omen his goddess,\nNow let the bride at length to her yearning spouse be delivered.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n12.\nNeither the nurse who comes at dawn to visit her nursling\nE'er shall avail her neck to begird with yesterday's ribband.\n[Speed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 spindles.]\nNor shall the mother's soul for ill-matcht daughter a-grieving\nLose by a parted couch all hopes of favourite grandsons.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\nThus in the bygone day Peleus' fate foretelling\nChaunted from breasts divine prophetic verse the Parcae.\nFor that the pure chaste homes of heroes to visit in person\nOft-tide the Gods, and themselves to display where mortals were gathered,\nWont were the Heavenlies while none human piety spurned.\nOften the Deities' Sire, in fulgent temple a-dwelling,\nWhenas in festal days received he his annual worship,\nLooked upon hundreds of bulls felled prone on pavement before him.\nFull oft Liber who roamed from topmost peak of\nParnassus\nHunted his howling host, his Thyiads with tresses dishevelled.\nThen with contending troops from all their city outflocking\nGladly the Delphians hailed their God with smoking of altars.\nOften in death-full war and bravest of battle, or Mavors\nOr rapid Triton's Queen or eke the Virgin Rhamnusian,\nBevies of weaponed men exhorting, proved their presence.\nBut from the time when earth was stained with unspeakable scandals\nAnd forth fro' greeding breasts of all men justice departed,\nThen did the brother drench his hands in brotherly bloodshed,\nStinted the son in heart to mourn decease of his parents,\nLongèd the sire to sight his first-born's funeral convoy\nSo more freely the flower of step-dame-maiden to rifle;\nAfter that impious Queen her guiltless son underlying,\nImpious, the household gods with crime ne'er dreading to sully—\nAll things fair and nefand being mixt in fury of evil\nTurned from ourselves avert the great goodwill of the Godheads.\nWherefor they nowise deign our human assemblies to visit,\nNor do they suffer themselves be met in light of the day-tide.",
      "Wikisource": "The pine trees formerly grown on Mt. Pelion's summit are said to have floated on Neptune's clear waves to Phasis' waters, and to King Aeëtes's lands, when the fittest young men, the glory of Argive manpower, hoping to steal the Golden Fleece from Colchis, dared travel over the sea's briny waters on a swift ship as they swept the deep blue expanse with fir-wood oars. For them, Athena Polias, holding the citadels on the cities' summits, made a ship that moves rapidly with a light gust of wind, joining pinewood frameworks to a curved keel. The Argo first drenched the virgin sea with its travel; as soon as it ploughed the windy sea with its beak, and the churned wave was whitened by the rowing, the maritime Nereids raised their faces from the sparkling whirlpool of the sea in admiration of the sight. The mortal men saw the sea nymphs with their own eyes, by one and no other light, standing naked up to their breasts out of the foamy sea. Then Peleus, inflamed, is carried away in love with Thetis, then Thetis did not scorn human marriage, then her father himself understands Peleus must be joined to Thetis. O heroes, born in a time much desired by the generations, hail, kin of the gods! O good offspring of good mothers, hail again...! You all, I'll address you often in my song, especially you, so especially honored with prosperous wedding torches, top man of Thessaly, O Peleus, to whom Jupiter himself, himself the father of the gods, gave his mistress. Did Thetis, the lovely Nereid, embrace you? Did Tethys and Oceanus, who in the sea embrace the whole world, grant you their granddaughter to marry? When that very same longed-for day arrived, all of Thessaly thronged to come together to the house, and the palace was filled with joyous crowding: they bore gifts before themselves, and show their delight by their faces. Cieros was abandoned, and so was Phthiotic Tempe; they left the houses of Crannon and the walls of Larisa; they came together at Pharsalus and filled Pharsalian houses. Nobody lived in the hinterland: the necks of young bulls had softened, the low grapevines hadn't been cleared out with curved hoes, no bull was tugging at the earth with a sloping plowshare, no more did the pruners' knife cut down the shade of a tree, but filthy rust had been accumulating on the lonely ploughs. Yet Peleus' home, wherever the opulent palace extended, is shining with gleaming gold and silver. Ivory shines on the thrones, drinking cups shine on the table, and the whole house, glittering, rejoiced in the royal treasure. The royal marriage bed is set for the goddess in the midst of the palace, refined with Indian tusk, while a purple tinge covers it with the rosy stain of shellfish. This bedspread, adorned with ancient figures of men, shows the virtues of heroes with amazing skill. And due to looking forth from Dia island's wave-sounding shore, bearing wild madness in her heart, Ariadne watches Theseus leaving with a swift fleet; not yet does even she believe that she sees what she sees, naturally since she, then having first awakened from deceptive sleep, discerns herself miserable having been deserted on the lone sand. But the forgetful, fleeing young man strikes the waters with oars, abandoning null promises to a storm full of wind. Whom the Minoan one far off from the seaweed with sorrowful little eyes, She stony as a statue of Bacchus, looks forth, alas, She looks forth and rages with great waves of cares, not retaining the delicate headdress on the blond head, not having been covered in respect to the chest in a light garment, not having been bound in respect to the milky breasts with polished bra, with all things which having slipped away from the whole body here and there The waves of salt were playing before the feet of that one. But neither then of the flowing cloth or of the hat she was hanging on you, Theseus, from the whole heart, from the whole spirit, from the whole mind having been lost. A! The miserable one, whom with constant sorrows frightened Eregina sowing thorny cares in the chest, at that storm, the fierce Theseus from which time having set out from the curved shores of Piraeus touches the Cretan temples of the unjust king. For once they say that Athens having been compelled by cruel plague to pay the penalties of the blood of Androgeos, at the same time was accustomed to give youths having been chosen and grave of the maidens as a sacrificial meal to the Minotaur. Now when his narrow walls were troubled by these evils, Theseus himself for his dear Athens chose to offer his own body, rather than that such deaths, living deaths, of Crecopia should be borne to Crete. And thus relying on the light ship and on the gentle breezes he comes to great spirited Minos and proud seats. As soon as the royal maiden caught sight of this one with a desiring eye whom the chaste little couch emitting sweet smells was nourishing in the soft embrace of the mother. just as the rivers of Eurota encircle myrtles or the spring breeze leads out distinctive colors, not earlier she turned away from that one passionate light, whom conceived the flame with all the body entirely and caught fire total in the deepest marrow. Alas wretchedly rousing the furies with savage heart, sacred Cupid, who you mix joy with the cares of men, and which you rule Golgos and leafy Idalium, you throw burning girl with what type of disorderly mind in the wave often the guest sighs! How many times you brought those fearing with weak heart! How great she turned pale of gold with great gleam, with Theseus seeking to fight against the savage monster or death or reward of praise! Not however she in vain promising little gifts to the gods and she undertakes prayers with a silent lip. For just as a wild whirlwind twisting the trunk with gust uprooting the oak tree shaking arms on the top of Taurus or cone bearing pine tree sweating bark, that one having been uprooted far off by the roots falls facedown, widely breaking every conceivable thing in the way, thus Theseus laid low the savage one with the body having been conquered in vain throwing the horns to the empty winds. From there the safe bent back the foot with great praise guiding footsteps wandering to the thin string lest the untraceable maze might trick the one going out from the labyrinthian bendings. But why should I having digressed from the first poem recall more things, how the daughter leaving behind the face of the father the embrace of the sister, and finally the embrace of the mother, who having been destroyed utterly used to be the happy in the sad daughter she preferred the sweet love of Theseus to all these things: or how having ben carried by raft to the foam filled shore of Dia she came, or the husband departing with a forgetful heart left behind he having been bound in respect to er eyes with sleep. Often they say that one raging with burning heart for they say that she poured from the deepest chest clearsounding voice, then they say that the sad one climbs the steep mountains, from where she might stretch forth her vision into the vast swells, then she runs forward into the opposing waves of the trembling salt raising the soft coverings of calf having been made bare. and they say that this very wretched one said these things with final lamentations, producing cold sobs with a wet mouth: Treacherous one, thus have you left me having carried away from fatherly altars, treacherous one, you felt me on the deserted shore, Theseus? thus, departing one with the divine will of the gods having been neglected forgetful A! did you carry the accursed false oaths of home? Was not anything able to bend the plan of the cruel mind? Was there any mercy for you available, so that a cruel heart might want to pity for us? But did you not give these promises with a seductive voice to me: you were not ordering for the sad one to hope for these things, bu happy unions, but desired weddings, all which worthless things the airy winds tear, Now already let no woman trust a man swearing, let none hope that the speeches of man are faithful,: for whom while the desiring mind is eager to grasp something, They fear to swear nothing, they spare to promise nothing. But as soon as the lust of the desiring mind has been satisfied, They feared the words as nothing, they care for the false oaths not at all. Certainly I snatched you as you turned in the middle whirlwind of death, and rather I decided to lose my brother, than to fail you, false man, in your utmost moment of need. For which I will be given to be torn to pieces as prey to wild beast and birds, and I, dead, will not be buried with dirt having been thrown over. Just what lioness produced you under the lonely crag, what sea spat you having been conceived in foaming waves out, which Syrtis, what rapacious Scylla, what vast Charybdis, you who [now] gives back such rewards for a sweet life? If our marriages had not been for you to the heart because you were bristling the savage rules of the ancient parent but however you were able to lead me into your seats, I who might serve you as a slave in joyful labor, caressing he white tracks with clear waters, or covering your bed with purple cloth. But why should I complain in vain to the unaware breezes, having been terrified by evil, which having been furnished with no senses They who are able neither to hear nor return the voices having been sent? That one however is being turned nearly in the middle waves, nor anyone mortal appears in the empty seaweed. Thus even savage fortune taunting too much in the final time begrudged ears for our complaints. All-powerful Jupiter, if only the Athenian ships had not touched the Cretan shores for the first time, nor the treacherous sailor bearing dreadful tributes for the wild bull had unbound the rope in Crete nor would that this evil man hiding cruel plans in sweet form had rested in our seats as a guest! For where should I bring myself back?  With what hope do I, ruined, rely? Should I seek the Cretan mountains? But with a wide whirlpool of the sea the savage surface separating divides. Or should I hope for the help of the father? Whom I left behind having followed the young man having been sprinkled with fraternal blood? Or should I console myself with the faithful love of the husband? Who flees bending the flexible oars in the sea? Besides the lonely island is being inhabited by no house, nor an escape lies open of the sea with waves girding. no method of flight, no hope: Everything is silent, all things are deserted, all things show death. Not however before the eyes will grow weak for me with death, nor before the senses withdraw from the tired body, I having been ruined will demand a just penalty from the gods. And I will pray for the faith of the heavenly ones in the final hour. Wherefore, Eumenides, punishing the deeds of men with avenging penalty, to whom the forehead having been encircled with snaky hair carries forth angers breathing out of the chest, here come here, hear my complaints, which I , alas wretched, have been compelled to bring forth from the bottom marrows helpless, burning, blind with crazy fury. Since such things are being born from the deepest chest, you don't suffer our grief to wane, but with what type of mind Theseus left me alone, let him pollute both himself and his own with death, goddesses. After she pour forth these voices from the sad chest, the troubled one demanding a punishment for savage deeds, the ruler of the heavenly ones nodded with unconquerable divine will; by which motion, the land and the bristling seas trembled and the universe shook the shining stars. Theseus himself having been planted in respect to the mind with blind darkness sent away all things with chest having forgotten. which orders before he was holding in a steady mind nor raising the sweet signals to the sad parent nor he shows that he himself safe saw the Athenian port. For once they say when Aegeus was entrusting the son leaving the walls of the goddess with a fleet to the winds, that he having embraced gave such orders to the youth: \"One and only son more precious to me than long life, son, whom I am forced to send away to dubious misfortunes, having been returned recently to me in the final end of old age, since my fortune and your passionate courage snatches you from uwilling me, to whom the weak eyes not yet satisfied by the dear figure of the son. I will not let thee go gladly with cheerful heart, nor suffer thee to bear the tokens of prosperous fortune: but first will bring forth many laments from my heart, soiling my gray hairs with earth and showered dust: thereafter will I hang dyed sails on thy roving mast, thast so the tale of my grief and the fire that burns in my heart may be marked by the canvas stained with Iberian azure. But if she who dwells in holy Itonus, who vouchsafes to defend our race and the abodes of Erechtheus, shall grant thee to sprinkle thy right hand with the bull's blood, then be sure that these my commands live, laid up in thy mindful heart, and that no length of time blur them: that as soon as thy eyes shall come within sight of our hills, thy yardarms may lay down from them there mourning raiment, and the twisted cordage raise a white sail: that so I may see at once and gladly welcome the signs of joy, when a happy hour shall set thee here in thy home again.\" These charges at first did Theseus preserve with constant mind; but then they left him, as clouds driven by the breath of the winds leave the lofty head of the snowy mountain. But the father, as he gazed out from his tower-top, wasting his longing eyes in constant tear-floods, when first he saw the canvas of the bellying sail, threw himself headlong from the summit of the rocks, believing Theseus destroyed by ruthless fate. Thus bold Theseus, as he entered the chambers of his home, darkened with mourning for his father's death, himself received such grief as by forgetfulness of heart he had caused to the daughter of Minos. And she the while, gazing out tearfully at the receding ship, was revolving manifold cares in her wounded heart. In another part of the tapestry youthful Bacchus was wondering with the rout of Satyrs and the Nysa-born Sileni, seeking thee, Ariadna, and fired with thy love; . . . . . . who then, busy here and there, were raging with frenzied mind, while \"Evoe!\" they cried tumultuously, \"Evoe!\" shaking their heads. Some of them were waving thyrsi with shrouded points, some tossing about the limbs of a mangled steer, some girding themselves with writhing serpents: some bearing in solemn procession dark mysteries in caskets, mysteries which the profane desire in vain to hear. Others beat timbrels with uplifted hands, or raised clear clashings with cymbals of rounded bronze: many blew horns with harsh-sounding drone, and the barbarian pipe shrilled with dreadful din. Such were the figures that richly adorned the tapestry which embraced and shrouded with its folds the royal couch. Now when the Thessalian youth had gazed their fill, fixing their eager eyes on these wonders, they began to give place to the holy gods. Hereupon, as the west wind ruffling the quiet sea with its breath at morn urges on the sloping waves, when the Dawn is rising up to the gates of the travelling Sun, the waters slowly at first, driven by gentle breeze, step on and lightly sound with plash of laughter; then as the breeze grows fresh they crowd on closer and closer, and floating afar reflect a brightness from the crimson light; so now, leaving the royal buildings of the portal, hither and thither variously with devious feet the guests passed away. After their departure, from the top of Pelion came Chiron leading the way, and bearing woodland gifts. For all the flowers that the plains bear, all that the Thessalian region brings to birth on its mighty mountains, all the flowers that near the river's streams the fruitful gale of warm Favonius discloses, these he brought himself, woven in mingled garlands, cheered with whose grateful odour the house smiled its gladness. Forthwith Penëus is there, leaving verdant Tempe, Tempe girt with impendent forests [ ] to be haunted by Dorian dances; not empty-handed, for he bore, torn up by the roots, lofty beeches and tall bay-trees with upright stem, and with them the nodding plane and the swaying sister of flame-devoured Phaethon, and the tall cypress. All these he wove far and wide around their home, that the portal might be greenly embowered with soft foliage. Him follows Prometheus wise of heart, bearing the faded scars of hte ancient penalty which whilom, his limbs bound fast to the rock with chains, he paid, hanging from the craggy summits. Then came the Father of the gods with his divine wife and his sons, leaving thee, Phoebus, alone in heaven, and with thee thine own sister who dwells in heights of Idrus; for as thou didst, so did thy sister scorn Peleus, nor deigned to be present at the nuptial torches of Thetis. So when they had reclined their limbs on the white couches, bountifully were the tables piled with varied dainties: whilst in the meantime, swaying their bodies with palsied motion, the Parcae began to utter soothtelling chants. White raiment enfolding their aged limbs robed their ankled with a crimson border; on their snowy heads rested rosy bands, while their hands duly plied the eternal task. The left hand helf the distaff clothed with soft wool; then the right hand lightly drawing out the threads with upturned fingers shaped them, then with downward thumb twirled the spindle poised with rounded whorl; and so with teeth they still plucked the threads and made the work even. Bitten ends of wool clung to their dry lips, which had before stood out from the smooth yarn: and at their feet soft fleeces of white-shining wool were kept safe in baskets of osier. They then, as they struck the wool, sang with clear voice, and thus poured forth the Fates in divine chant. That chant no length of time shall prove untruthful. \"O thou who crownest high renown with great deeds of virtue, bulwark of Emathian power, famed for thy son to be, receive the truthful oracle that on this happy day the Sisters reveal to thee; but run ye on, drawing the woof-threads which the fates follow, ye spindles, run. Soon will Hesperus come to thee, Hesperus, who brings longed-for gifts to the wedded, soon will come thy wife with happy star, to shed over thy spirit soul-quelling love, and join with thee languorous slumbers, laying her smooth arms under thy strong neck. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. No house ever harboured such loves as these; no love ever joined lovers in such a bond as links Thetis with Peleus, Peleus with Thetis. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. There shall be born to you a son that knows not fear, Achilles, known to his enemies not by his back but by his stout breast; who right often winner in the contest of the wide-ranging race shall outstrip the flame-feet footsteps of the flying hind. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. Against him not a hero shall match himself in war, when the Phrygian streams shall flow with Teucrian blood, and the third heir of Pelops shall lay waste the Trojan walls, with tedious war beleaguering. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. The hero's surpassing achievements and renowned deeds often shall mothers own at the burial of their sons, loosing dishevelled hair from hoary head, and marring their withered breasts with weak hands. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. For as the husbandman cropping the thick ears of corn under the burning sun mows down the yellow fields, so shall he lay low with foeman's steel the bodies of the sons of Troy. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. Witness of his great deeds of valour shall be the wave of Scamander which pours itself forth abroad in the current of Hellespont, whose channel he shall choke with heaps of slain corpses, and make the deep streams warm with mingled blood. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. Lastly, witness too shall be the prize assigned to him in death, when the rounded barrow heaped up with lofty mound shall receive the snowy limbs of the slaughtered maiden. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. For so soon as Fortune shall give to the weary Achaeans power to loose the Neptune-forged circlet of the Dardanian town, the high tomb shall be wetted with Polyxena's blood, who like a victim falling under the two-edged steel, shall bend her knee and bow her headless trunk. Run, drawing, the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. Come then, unite the loves which your souls desire: let the husband receive in happy bonds the goddess, let the bride be given up—nay now!—to her eager spouse. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run. When her nurse visits her again with the morning light, she will not be able to circle her neck with yesterday's riband; nor shall her anxious mother, saddened by lone-lying of an unkindly bride, give up the hope of dear descendants. Run, drawing the woof-threads, ye spindles, run.\" Such strains of divination, foreboding happiness to Peleus, sang the Fates from prophetic breast in days of yore. For in bodily presence of old, before religion was despised, the heavenly ones were wont to visit pious homes of heroes, and show themselves to mortal company. Often the Father of the gods coming down again, in his bright temple, when yearly feasts had come on his holy days, saw a hundred bulls fall to the ground. Often Liber roving on the topmost height of Parnassus drove the Thyades crying \"Evoe!\" with flying hair, when the Delphians, racing eagerly from all the town, joyfully received the god with smoking altars. Often in the death-bearing strife of war Mavors or the Lady of swift Triton or the Rhamnusian Virgin by their presence stirred up the courage of armed bands of men. But when the earth was dyed with hideous crime, and all men banished justice from their greedy souls, and brothers sprinkled their hands with brothers' blood, the son left off to mourn his parents' death, the father wished for the death of his young son, that he might without hindrance enjoy the flower of a young bride, the unnatural mother impiously coupling with her unconscious son did not fear to sin against parental gods; then all right and wrong, confounded in impious madness, turned from us the righteous will of the gods. Wherefore they deign not to visit such companies, nor endure the touch of clear daylight.",
      "PoetryinTranslation": "Once they say pine-trees born on the heights of Pelion\nfloated through Neptune ’s clear waves,\nto the River Phasis and Aeetes ’s borders,\nwith chosen men, oaks of the Argive people,\nhoping to steal the Golden Fleece of Colchis\ndaring to course the salt deeps in their swift ship,\nsweeping the blue waters with fir-wood oars.\nThe goddess herself who guards the heights of the city,\nwho joined the curving fabric to pinewood keel,\nmade their ship speed onwards with light winds.\nThat vessel was first to explore the unknown sea:\nso, as she ploughed the windblown waters with her prow,\nand whitened the churning waves with foam from the oars,\nthe Nereids lifted themselves from the dazzling white\ndepths of the sea, amazed at this wonder of ocean.\nIn those, and other days, mortal eyes saw the sea-nymphs\nraise themselves, bodies all naked, as far as their nipples,\nfrom the white depths.\nThen Peleus , they say, was inflamed with love of Thetis ,\nthen Thetis did not despise marriage with a mortal,\nthen Jupiter himself agreed to Thetis’s marriage.\nO heroes, born in a chosen age, hail, godlike race!\nO offspring of a blessed mother, hail once more.\nOften I’ll address you, in my song.\nAnd I address you, so blessed in your fortunate marriage,\nchief of Pelian Thessaly, to whom Jupiter himself\ncreator of gods, yielded his beloved:\ndid not Thetis possess you, loveliest of Nereids?\nDid not Tethys allow you to lead off her grand-daughter,\nand Oceanus , who embraces the whole world with sea?\nWhen at the time appointed the longed-for flames arise,\nall of Thessaly crowds together to the palace,\nthe halls are filled with a joyful assembly:\nthey bring gifts with them, declaring their joy in their looks.\nCieros is deserted: they leave Pthiotic Tempe ,\nCrannon ’s houses, and Larissa ’s walls,\nthey gather in Pharsalia , crowd under Pharsalia’s roofs.\nNo one farms the fields, the necks of bullocks soften,\nnor does the curved hoe clear beneath the vines,\nnor does the ox drag earth outward with the blade,\nnor does the sickle thin the shade of leafy trees,\ncoarse rust attacks the neglected plough.\nBut the palace gleams bright with gold and silver\nthrough all the rich receding halls.\nThe ivory chairs shine, cups glisten on tables,\nthe whole palace gladdened with splendour of royal wealth.\nIn the midst of the palace a sacred couch, truly joyful\nfor the marriage of the goddess, gleaming with Indian ivory,\nstained with the red dyes won from purple murex.\nThe cloth depicts in ancient forms, with marvellous art,\nin all their variety, the excellence of gods and men.\nHere are seen the wave-echoing shores of Naxos ,\nTheseus , aboard his ship, vanishing swiftly, watched\nby Ariadne , ungovernable passion in her heart,\nnot yet believing that she sees what she does see,\nstill only just awoken from deceptive sleep,\nfinding herself abandoned wretchedly to empty sands.\nBut uncaring the hero fleeing strikes the deep with his oars,\ncasting his vain promises to the stormy winds.\nThe Minoan girl goes on gazing at the distance,\nwith mournful eyes, like the statue of a Bacchante ,\ngazes, alas, and swells with great waves of sorrow,\nno longer does the fine turban remain on her golden hair,\nno longer is she hidden by her lightly-concealing dress,\nno longer does the shapely band hold her milk-white breasts\nall of it scattered, slipping entirely from her body,\nplays about her feet in the salt flood.\nBut, not caring now for turban or flowing dress, the lost girl\ngazed towards you, Theseus, with all her heart, spirit, mind.\nWretched thing, for whom bright Venus reserved the thorny\ncares of constant mourning in your heart,\nfrom that time when it suited warlike Theseus,\nleaving the curving shores of Piraeus ,\nto reach the Cretan regions of the unbending king.\nFor then forced by cruel plague, they say,\nas punishment, to absolve the murder of Androgeos\nten chosen young men of Athens and ten unmarried girls\nused to be given together as sacrifice to the Minotaur .\nWith which evil the narrow walls were troubled until\nTheseus chose to offer himself for his dear Athens\nrather than such Athenian dead be carried un-dead to Crete.\nAnd so in a swift ship and with gentle breezes\nhe came to great Minos and his proud halls.\nAs soon as the royal girl cast her eye on him with desire,\nshe whom the chaste bed nourished, breathing\nsweet perfumes in her mother’s gentle embrace,\neven as Eurotas ’s streams surround a myrtle\nthat sheds its varied colours on the spring breeze,\nshe did not turn her blazing eyes away from him,\ntill she conceived a flame through her whole body\nthat burned utterly to the depths of her bones.\nAh sadly the Boy incites inexorable passion\nin chaste hearts, he who mixes joy and pains for mortals,\neven she, who shakes the mind of a smitten girl,\noften sighing for a blonde-haired stranger!\nHow many fears the girl suffers in her weak heart!\nHow often she grows pallid: more so than pale gold.\nAs Theseus went off eager to fight the savage monster\neither death approached or fame’s reward!\nPromising small gifts, not unwelcome or in vain,\nshe made her prayers to the gods with closed lips.\nNow as a storm uproots a quivering branch of oak,\nor a cone-bearing pine with resinous bark, on the heights\nof Mount Taurus , twisting its unconquered strength\nin the wind (it falls headlong, far off, plucked out\nby the roots, shattering anything and everything in its way)\nso Theseus upended the conquered body of the beast\nits useless horns overthrown, emptied of breath.\nThen he turned back, unharmed, to great glory,\nguided by the wandering track of fine thread,\nso that his exit from the fickle labyrinth of the palace\nwould not be prevented by some unnoticed error.\nBut what should I relate, digressing further\nfrom my poem’s theme: the girl, abandoning\nher father’s sight, her sisters’ embraces, and lastly\nher mother’s, she wretched at her lost daughter’s joy\nin preferring the sweet love of Theseus to all this:\nor her being carried by ship to Naxos’s foaming shore,\nor her consort with uncaring heart vanishing,\nshe conquered, her eyes softening in sleep?\nOften loud shrieks cried the frenzy in her ardent heart\npoured out from the depths of her breast,\nand then she would climb the steep cliffs in her grief,\nwhere the vast sea-surge stretches out to the view,\nthen run against the waves into the salt tremor\nholding her soft clothes above her naked calves,\nand call out mournfully this last complaint,\na frozen sob issuing from her wet face:\nfaithless man, to abandon me on a desert shore?\nIs this how you vanish, heedless of the god’s power,\nah, uncaring, bearing home your accursed perjuries?\nNothing could alter the measure of your cruel mind?\nNo mercy was near to you, inexorable man,\nthat you might take pity on my heart?\nYet once you made promises to me in that flattering voice,\nyou told me to hope, not for this misery\nbut for joyful marriage, the longed-for wedding songs,\nall in vain, dispersed on the airy breezes.\nNow, no woman should believe a man’s pledges,\nor believe there’s any truth in a man’s words:\nwhen their minds are intent on their desire,\nthey have no fear of oaths, don’t spare their promises:\nbut as soon as the lust of their eager mind is slaked\nthey fear no words, they care nothing for perjury.\nSurely I rescued you from the midst of the tempest\nof fate, and more, I gave up my half-brother,\nwhom I abandoned to you with treachery at the end.\nFor that I’m left to be torn apart by beasts, and a prey\nto sea-birds, unburied, when dead, in the scattered earth.\nWhat lioness whelped you under a desert rock,\nwhat sea conceived and spat you from foaming waves,\nwhat Syrtis , what fierce Scylla , what vast Charybdis ,\nyou who return me this, for the gift of your sweet life?\nIf marriage with me was not in your heart,\nbecause you feared your old father’s cruel precepts,\nyou could still have led me back to your house,\nwhere I would have served you, a slave happy in her task,\nwashing your beautiful feet in clear water,\ncovering your bed with the purple fabric.\nBut why complain to the uncaring wind in vain?\nIt is beyond evil, and without senses, unable\nto hear what is said, without voice to reply.\nIt is already turning now towards mid-ocean,\nand nothing human appears in this waste of weed.\nSo cruel chance taunts me in my last moments,\neven depriving my ears of my own lament.\nAll-powerful Jupiter , if only the Athenian ships\nhad not touched the shores of Cnossos , from the start,\ncarrying their fatal cargo for the ungovernable bull,\na faithless captain mooring his ropes to Crete,\nan evil guest, hiding a cruel purpose under a handsome\nappearance, finding rest in our halls!\nNow where can I return? What desperate hope\ndepend on? Shall I seek out the slopes of Ida ?\nBut the cruel sea with its divisive depths\nof water separates me from them.\nOr shall I hope for my father’s help? Did I not leave him,\nto follow a man stained with my brother’s blood?\nOr should I trust in a husband’s love to console me?\nWho hardly bends slow oars in running from me?\nMore, I’m alive on a lonely island without shelter,\nand no escape seen from the encircling ocean waves.\nNo way to fly, no hope: all is mute,\nall is deserted, all speaks of ruin.\nYet still my eyes do not droop in death,\nnot till my senses have left my weary body,\ntill true justice is handed down by the gods,\nand the divine help I pray for in my last hour.\nSo you Eumenides who punish by avenging\nthe crimes of men, your foreheads crowned\nwith snaky hair, bearing anger in your breath,\nhere, here, come to me, listen to my complaints,\nthat I, wretched alas, force, weakened, burning,\nout of the marrow of my bones, blind with mad rage.\nSince these truths are born in the depths of my breast,\nyou won’t allow my lament to pass you by,\nbut as Theseus left me alone, through his intent,\ngoddesses, by that will, pursue him and his with murder.’\nWhen these words had poured from her sad breast,\nthe troubled girl praying for cruel actions,\nthe chief of the gods nodded with unconquerable will:\nat which the earth and the cruel sea trembled\nand the glittering stars shook in the heavens.\nNow Theseus’s mind was filled with a dark mist\nand all the instructions he had held fixed in memory\nbefore this, were erased from his thoughts,\nfailing to raise the sweet signal to his mourning father,\nwhen the harbour of Athens safely came in sight.\nFor they say that when Aegeus parted from his son,\nas the goddess’s ship left the city, he yielded him\nto the wind’s embrace with these words:\nson, whom I abandoned through chance uncertainty,\nlately returned to me in the last days of my old age,\nsince my fate and your fierce virtue tear you away\nfrom me, against my will, whose failing eyes\nare not yet sated with my dear son’s face,\nI don’t send you off happily with joyful heart,\nor allow you to carry flags of good fortune,\nbut start with the many sorrows in my mind,\nmarring my white hairs with earth and sprinkled ashes,\nthen hang unfinished canvas from the wandering mast,\nso the darkened sail of gloomy Spanish flax\nmight speak the grief and passion in my mind.\nBut if the one who dwells in sacred Iton , who promised\nto defend the people and city of Erectheus , allows you\nto wet your hand with the blood of the bull,\nthen make sure this command is done, buried in your\nremembering heart, not to be erased by time:\nthat as soon as you set eyes on our hills,\nstrip the dark fabric fully from the yards,\nand hoist white sails with your twisted ropes,\nso that seeing them from the first, I’ll know joy\nin my glad heart, when a happy time reveals your return.’\nThese words to Theseus, once held constantly in mind,\nvanished like clouds of snow struck by a blast of wind\non the summits of high mountains.\nBut when his father, searching the view from the citadel’s height,\nendless tears flooding his anxious eyes,\nfirst saw the sails of dark fabric,\nhe threw himself head first from the height of the cliff,\nbelieving Theseus lost to inexorable fate.\nSo fierce Theseus entered the palace in mourning\nfor his father’s death, and knew the same grief of mind\nthat he had caused neglected Ariadne,\nshe who was gazing then where his ship had vanished\npondering the many cares in her wounded heart.\nBut bright Bacchus hurries from elsewhere\nwith his chorus of Satyrs and Silenes from Nysa,\nseeking you, Ariadne, burning with love for you.\nIn rapture his Bacchantes raved madly, crazed in mind,\nwith cries of ‘ euhoe ’ and tossing heads,\nsome brandished the thyrsus with hidden tip,\nsome flourished the torn limbs of bullocks,\nsome wreathed themselves with twining snakes,\nsome celebrated the secret rites of the hollow box,\nrights they wished the profane to hear in vain:\nothers beat the drums with the flat of their hands,\nor raised a clear ringing from rounded cymbals:\nthey blew endless strident calls on the horns\nand the barbarous flute shrilled with fearful tunes.\nSuch the splendid workings of figured tapestry\ncovering the sacred couch its cloth embraced.\nThe people of Thessaly after gazing eagerly\nwere satisfied, they began to leave the goddess’s sanctuary.\nAs Zephyr stirs the willing waves, ruffling\nthe placid sea with morning breeze,\nwhile Aurora rises to the wandering Sun’s threshold,\nso that at first they move slowly struck by a gentle blast,\nand their splashing resounds with slight lamentation,\nwhile afterwards they increase, swelling more and more,\nand reflect the red of the sunrise far-off as they rise:\nso, here and there, with wandering feet the crowd disperse\nto their homes, leaving the courtyard of the royal palace.\nAfter their departure Chiron , the Centaur’s leader,\narrived from steep Pelion carrying woodland gifts:\nsince what the fields bear, whatever the country of Thessaly\nyields on high peaks, whatever the flowers by the river’s waves\nthe fecund breath of the warm west wind produces,\nhe brought woven together in confused garlands,\nso that the palace smiled, charmed by happy fragrances.\nAt once Peneus came to green Tempe ,\nTempe, whose hanging woods encircle it above,\nleaving Pasiphae to be honoured by the sea’s dance:\nnot empty-handed, since he carried a tall beech\nby the roots, and long-leafed laurel from a straight trunk,\nand was not without nodding plane, and pliant poplar,\nscorched Phaethon ’s sister, and airy cypress.\nHe placed them woven, here and there, round the house\ntill the courtyard was green, veiled with fresh foliage.\nPrometheus followed after him, skilled in mind,\nshowing faint traces of his ancient punishment,\nwhen once he suffered, hung in tight chains\nfrom the high ledge of rock.\nThen the father of the gods with his sacred consort,\nand his sons, came down from the heavens,\nleaving behind only you, Phoebus , and the one born\ntogether with you, she who lives on the slopes of Ida :\nPeleus is still disdained by both you and your sister ,\nand you will not celebrate Thetis’s wedding torches.\nThen the gods seated their limbs at the white benches,\nat tables richly heaped with various foods,\nwhile, moving their bodies in trembling dance,\nthe Fates began to utter their prophetic song.\nQuivering seized their bodies, their white ankles\nwholly covered by the red hem of their dresses,\nand a red headband circling their white hair,\nand their hands were busy, as ever, at their eternal work.\nThe left hand held the distaff, wound with soft wool,\nthen the right, drawing out the thread lightly, shaped it\nwith upturned fingers, then, twisting it under the thumb,\nturned the level spindle in smooth rotation,\nand often a plucking tooth made the strands equal,\nand fragments of wool, that once projected\nfrom the light threads, clung to their dry lips:\nand, before their feet, bright wool from a soft fleece\nwas guarded by a basket woven of willow.\nThen in a clear voice, pushing away the fleece,\nthey poured out these prophecies in divine song,\nsong not to be proven wrong, by any amount of years.\nadding marvellous glory to your great powers,\naccept what the glad sisters bring to the light,\ntrue oracles: but you who accompany fate,\nfly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nNow Hesperus comes to you bearing the longed-for\nbride, the wife approaches beneath a fortunate star,\nwho pours out her heart to you with tender love,\nand prepares to lie with you in languid sleep,\nspreading her delicate arms beneath your strong neck.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nNo house has ever sheltered such love,\nno love has ever joined lovers in such a union,\neven as harmony comes to Thetis, and Peleus.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nA child Achilles is born to you, free of fear,\nnoted for never turning his back on an enemy, strong\nof heart, who, often the victor in the fickle foot-race,\noutstrips the swift deer with fiery hooves.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nNo hero dare confront him in battle,\nwhen the Phrygian rivers flow with the blood of Teucer ’s people,\nand the third heir of deceitful Pelops lays waste\nthe walls of Troy , besieged in the weary war.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nOften women at the funerals of their sons lament\nhis illustrious powers and bright deeds,\nas neglected hair streams down from their white heads,\nand weak hands mark their withered breasts.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nNow, as a reaper prematurely mowing the dense stalks,\nscythes the golden fields under his eager feet,\nhe destroys the Trojan bodies with his fierce blade.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nScamander ’s waves that pour down in cascade to the swift\nHellespont will bear witness to his great courage,\nits passage narrowed by the heaped bodies of

smooth white body of a sacrificed virgin girl.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nThen as luck grants the riches of the Trojan city\nto the weary Greeks , loosening Neptune ’s bond,\nthe high mound will be soaked with Polyxena ’s blood:\nwho bowing like a sacrifice to the two-edged blade\nwill fall to her knees, a maimed corpse.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nSo perform the wishes of your hearts, join in love.\nLet the husband accept his goddess in joyful contract,\nnow the bride be given to her loving partner.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.\nThe nurse returning at daybreak will not\nencircle her neck with yesterday’s ribbon,\nnor the anxious mother by the sad bed of a troubled daughter,\nforgo the hope of dear grandchildren.\nFly, guiding threads: fly, spindle.’\nSuch the song once sung of happy prophecy\nto Peleus, from the Parcae ’s divine hearts.\nOnce the gods in person visited the pure houses of heroes,\nand showed themselves to the mortal crowd,\nthe gods were not yet used to men’s scorn for piety.\nOften the father of the gods revisiting his bright temple,\nwhen the annual rites came round on the holy days,\nsaw a hundred bulls lying on the ground.\nWandering Bacchus often led the shouting Bacchantes ,\nwith their flowing hair, on the high peak of Parnassus ,\nwhen all rushing in emulation from the happy town\nof Delphos received the god with smoking altars.\nOften in the fatal struggles of war, Mars , or swift Minerva\nthe lady of Lake Tritonis, or virgin Artemis\nappeared to exhort the crowds of armed men.\nBut afterwards earth was tainted by impious wickedness\nand all fled from justice with eager minds,\nthe brother’s hand was stained with a brother’s blood,\nthe child ceased to mourn for its dead parents,\nthe father chose the younger son’s death to acquire\na single woman in her prime, the impious mother\nspread herself beneath the unknowing son,\nnot afraid of desecrating the household shrine.\nAll piety was confused with impiety in evil frenzy\nturning the righteous will of the gods from us.\nSo such as they do not visit our marriages,\nnor allow themselves to approach us, in the light of day."

      "Negenborn": "Conon searched the heavenly bodies of the vast sky and saw\nthe risings and settings of the stars, how the fiery\nbrightness of the scorching sun is darkened, how heavenly\nbodies depart at certain times, and how, from any orbit in\nthe air, sweet love stealthily calls Diana down and banishes\nher under the rocks of Latmus: that selfsame Conon, in the\nlight of the heavens, saw me, a lock of long hair from the\ncrown of Berenice's head. As I shimmered, Berenice promised\nme to many of the goddesses as she stretched her smooth arms\nforth, and in that season a king, glorified by his new\nmarriage, had gone to sack Syrian land; he carried\nvictorious marks from a nocturnal brawl that he had\nconducted for the spoils of a virgin. But is sex really\nbaleful to brides? Or can it be that their parents\npleasures are spoiled by the duplicitous tearlets that\nbrides shed in torrents within the bedroom's doorway? The\ngods sigh over these questions and therefore would not\nplease me. By her many complaints, her majesty taught me\nthis when her new husband went to witness fierce battles:\nwhen you were alone, Berenice, you mourned not your\ndestitute couch, but your lamentable separation from your\nbrother, the second Ptolemy! How deeply your anxiety has\neaten away at your sad interior! Your senses had been\nsnatched away, and how your mind failed you then, when you\nwere anxious with all your heart! Nevertheless, I knew for a\nfact that you were brave since you were a little girl. Can\nit be that you have forgotten the good intrigue whereby you\nwon your royal spouse because nobody else dared more\nbravely? But what sad words you spoke then, as you were\nletting your husband go! O Jupiter, how often you rubbed\nyour eyes with your hand! What such a god has changed you?\nCan it be because lovers do not want to be away from a dear\nbody? And then you offered me, not without the blood of a\nbull, to all of the gods in return for your sweet husband,\nif it would bring his return. He had added captured Asia\nMinor to the borders of Egypt in what was not a long time.\nIn return for these deeds, as a novel offering of thanks, I\nrepay ancient prayers fulfilled by the heavenly crowds.\nUnwillingly, your majesty, I departed from your head,\nunwillingly: I swear by you and your head, but if anyone\nwill have foolishly sworn by this, may he get the things he\ndeserves; but who would claim that he is equal to scissors?\nThat largest mountain in the land, over which the bright sun\nis driven, was also brought down when the Persians produced\na new sea and when a barbaric soldiery sailed by fleet\nthrough the center of Athos. What will hair do, when such\nthings fall because of an iron blade? O Jupiter, I wish that\nthe Chalybes and those who first began to look underground\nfor veins of ore and draw the hardness of iron into bars\nwould perish! My sisters were mourning my fate, the fate of\nhair recently severed, when the brother of Ethiopian king\nMemnon, beating against the air with changing wings,\npresented himself as the winged horse of Locrian Arsinoë,\nand, carrying me off through the shades of the sky, flew\naway to place me on the chaste lap of Venus. Arsinoë\nZephyritis, who is Venus herself, the Greek inhabitant of\nCanopus' shores, had sent her servant there as an envoy.\nFrom that point, in order that the golden crown from\nAriadne's times should not become fixed alone in the sky's\ndappled radiance, but that the both of us should shine as\ndedicated mementos of a blonde head, divine Venus placed me\nin the regions of the gods, a new constellation among\nancient constellations as I was damp, departing from a wave.\nFor, touching the light of Virgo and savage Leo, and close\nto Callisto, who stands next to her father Lycaon, I wheel\nto my setting, leading the way before slow Boötes, who is\nimmersed quite late in deep Oceanus. But although the\nfootprints of the gods weigh me down at night, the light of\nday nevertheless gives me back to white haired Tethys.\n(Nemesis, by your leave, may I speak here? I will not hide\ntruths out of fear, and if the stars will tear me to pieces\nfor my troublesome words, I will not hide truths and fail to\nreveal what has been put away in a true heart.) I do not\nrejoice in these circumstances so much as I am vexed that\nI'll always, always be absent from the head of my mistress,\nthe one with whom I drank many thousands of unguents, while\nshe was a young girl formerly devoid of all perfumes. Now\nyou, whom the wedding torch has united by a hoped for flame\nand who look after the laws with a chaste bed, when your\nclothing has been thrown aside, do not entrust your bodies\nto your like-minded husbands as you denude your breasts,\nbefore an onyx jar, your onyx jar, pours me its delightful\nlibations. But she who has given herself to morally foul\nadultery - oh! - the shallow dust drinks her vain and\nmalicious gifts; I seek no offerings from unworthy people.\nBut rather, you wives, may harmony and an unremitting love\nalways, always inhabit your homes. To be sure, your majesty,\nwhen you appease the divine Venus as you look at the stars\non holidays, do not allow me, who am your own, to go\nunanointed, but rather treat me with abundant offerings. I\nwish that the stars would fall down! I wish that I were to\nbecome royal hair and that Orion were now shining by\nAquarius!\nTaken with kind permission from Brendan",

      "Negenborn": "O Door, delightful to a charming husband, delightful to one\nwith children, hello, and may Jupiter bless you with good\nfortune, which they say once served Balbus well when he held\nthe house as an old man, but which they say served his son\ngrudgingly after your marriage, when the old man had been\nstretched out in death. Come, tell us why you are said to\nhave changed and forsaken your trust in the old lord. (Thus\nmay I please Caecilius, to whom I now have been handed\nover): it is not my fault, though it is said to be mine, and\nnobody can speak of any offense of mine; it is truly the\njudgment of the populace that the door does each deed.\nWherever it is discovered that something has not been done\nin a moral manner, they all shout at me, \"Door, it's your\nfault!\" But it is not enough for you to say that which I\nmention in one word, to make anyone see and understand. \"How\nam I able? Nobody asks or seeks to understand.\" We are\nwilling: don't hesitate to tell us. First of all, as for the\nstory that a young woman was entrusted to me, that's a lie.\nGranted, her first husband didn't touch her; his drooping\npenis, more flaccid than a tender beet, never raised itself\nto the middle of his tunic, but the father of the son is\nsaid to have defiled the couch and stained the hapless house\nwith scandal, whether because his irreverent mind burned\nwith blind lust, or because his lazy son had sterile semen,\nso that from somewhere a more sinewy member was to be\nsought, which could untie the chastity belt of a virgin. You\ngive an account, with remarkably dutiful respect, of an\nillustrious father, who himself urinated on the lap of his\nown son: \"You haven't heard the half of it: Brescia, placed\nat the foot of Cycnus' lookout point, and past which golden\nMella runs as a gentle river, mother Brescia, loved in my\nVerona, says she knows for a fact not only this, but also\ntells about trysts with Postumius and Cornelius, with whom\nthat woman committed a grievous act of adultery. At this\npoint, someone might say, 'What? You know all these things\nyou're telling me, Door, you to whom being absent from your\nmaster's doorway and eavesdropping on people is never\npermitted, but attached here beneath the lintel, are you\naccustomed only to opening and closing the house?' I often\nheard her speaking in a furtive voice alone with her\nservants about these outrages of hers and mentioning by name\nthose whom I have mentioned, naturally anticipating that I\nhave neither tongue nor ear. Moreover, she would add mention\nof a particular man whom I don't want to name lest he raise\nhis red eyebrows in anger.

Come now, tell us why you are said to have changed and to have deserted your old loyalty to your master. \"It is not (may I so please Caecilius to whom I have now been handed over) my fault, although it is said to be mine, no one can speak of any wrongdoing by me: but it is the judgement of people that the door does each deed, who, whenever something is found out to have been done badly, they all shout at me: Door, it is your fault.\" It is not enough that you say that in one word. But make it so that anyone can feel and see it. \"How can I? Nobody asks nor tries to understand.\" I want to: do not hesitate to tell me. \"Therefore first, what was said about her having been handed over to us a virgin is false. Her husband did not touch her before, he whose little dagger hung weaker than a soft beet, and never raised itself to the middle of his tunic; but his father is said to have violated the bed of that son, and dishonored his wretched home, either because his impious mind burned with a blind love, or because his son was infertile with barren seed, so something more vigorous had to be sought elsewhere, which could loosen her virgin belt.\" You tell of an outstanding parent with amazing dutifulness, who himself has pissed in his own son's lap! \"And yet it's not only this that Brixia says it has knowledge of, Brixia, situated below the watchtower of Cycnus, which the golden Mella runs past with its gentle stream, Brixia, the beloved mother of my Verona, but it tells about Postumius and the love of Cornelius, with whom she committed terrible adultery. At this point someone may say, \"Door, how do you know that, when you are never allowed to be away from your master's threshold, nor to eavesdrop on people, but fixed here under this little beam you are only accustomed to open or close the house? Often I heard her speaking with a furtive voice alone with her slave-girls about these misdeeds of hers, mentioning by name those I have spoken of, as if she expected me to have neither a tongue nor a little ear. Moreover she added someone else, whom I do not want to mention by name, in case he raises his red eyebrows.

      "Negenborn": "That you, overwhelmed by fortune and bitter plight, send me\nthis short letter, written down with tears, that I may\nrescue one shipwrecked, expelled by the frothing waves of\nthe sea, and bring him back in health from the threshold of\ndeath, him whom heavenly Venus provides no relief, alone in a\ncelibate bed, in languid sleep, nor Muses delight with sweet\nsong of ancient writers when your mind stays anxiously awake\nall night, pleases me because you tell me I'm your friend\nand seek the gifts both of the Muses and of Venus. But lest\nyou not know my misfortunes, Manius, or think I rue my\nguest's obligation, listen, lest you further seek from a\nmiserable man the blessed gifts wherewith I myself am\nsubmerged in the waves of Fortune. At that time when a grown\nman's toga was first handed down to me, when the age, rife\nwith flowers, issued a pleasant spring, I had plenty of\nplayful affairs: the goddess is well aware of us, she who\nmixes our sweet bitterness with cares. But grief over my\nbrother's death has taken this pastime away from me\nentirely. My brother, unhappily removed from me, as you were\ndying, you broke my advantages; my brother, our whole house\nwas buried along with you, and all our joys perished along\nwith you, joys which your kind friendship nurtured in life.\nBecause of untimely death I have expelled from my entire\nconsciousness these pastimes and all delights of the mind.\nWherefore, because you write that it is shameful for\nCatullus to be in Verona, because here, anyone who is anyone\nwould be wont to warm limbs cold from a lonely bed, it is\nnot just a shame, Manius, but a source of real grief.\nTherefore, please forgive me if I do not grant you the gifts\nwhich grief has taken from me, for I cannot so grant them.\nFor, as for the fact that I do not have a great abundance of\nwritings at my family home in Verona, it happens that we\nlive in Rome: that house, that home of mine, there my life\nis browsed, and one small scroll case out of many follows me\nhere. Since it is so, I wouldn't want you to decide that I'm\ndoing this out of spite or lack of appropriate generosity\nbecause an abundance of neither kind of poem has been sent\nto you though you have sought it. If any such abundance were\nforthcoming, I would produce it unasked. I cannot keep\nsilent, ye goddesses, about the matter with which Allius\nManius has helped me, or about the extent of the obligations\nwith which he has helped me, lest his life, which slips away\nas the generations forget, cover this zeal with a blind\nnight: but I'll tell you, hereafter tell many thousands and\nmake this roll of papyrus speak when it is old... ...When he\nis dead, may he become more and more famous, and may no\nspider do her work, weaving a thin web high upon Allius'\nlonely name! You know what concern two-faced Venus has given\nme, and in what manner she has parched me, for I've been\nburning like Etna's Sicilian crag or the waters of Malis in\nthe hot gates of Mount Oeta, and my hapless eyes have not\nstopped wasting away in unremitting tears, and my cheeks\nhave not stopped being wet with the gloomy tears of rain. As\na stream, shining on the summit of an airy mountain, a\nstream that rushes forth from the mossy stone, cuts through\nthe way of a dense population and suddenly rolls from a\nsloping valley is sweet comfort to a tired, sweaty traveler\nwhen severely hot weather cracks the parched fields, and\nprecisely as a second wind that comes blowing rather gently\nis sweet comfort after sailors have been buffeted about in a\nblack tornado, such help has Allius Manius been to me, now\nthat the prayers of Castor and Pollux have been issued. With\na wide path, he has opened up a shut plain, and he has given\na home to me and to Lesbia, to which she and I would come to\nply our mutual love. My radiant goddess brought herself\nfleetly to Allius' home and set her foot's gleaming sole in\nthe worn doorway, her weight balanced on a squeaky sandal,\nas Laodamia, burning with love, once came to the house of\nher husband Protesilaus, a house begun in vain, since no\nsacrificial animal had yet appeased the heavenly masters\nwith its holy blood. Nemesis, nothing of the sort that is\nundertaken recklessly, when the gods are unwilling, would\nplease me so very much. Laodamia learned how the hungry\naltar longed for upright blood when her husband was taken\naway, and she was compelled to let go of her new husband's\nneck before the return of winter had satisfied her\npassionate love in the long nights, with the result that she\nwas able to live after breaking off the marriage, which the\nFates knew would not be a long way off if he went as a\nsoldier to Troy. At that time, with the abduction of Helen,\nTroy had begun to rouse the chief men of the Argives toward\nherself, Troy (horror!), shared tomb of Asia and Europe,\nTroy, cruel funeral pyre of all men and virtues, which has\neven brought a miserable death to my brother! Our whole\nhouse has been buried together with you, and all our joys\nhave perished together with you, which your sweet friendship\nnurtured in life. A foreign land holds him deep under ground\nnow, so far away, not among familiar tombs, and not placed\nbeside the ashes of relatives, but buried unhappily in Troy,\nloathsome Troy! Whither, then, the conscripted men of\nGreece, hurrying from all directions to forsake their\ndomestic hearths, are drawn, lest Paris, having rejoiced\nafter Helen was enticed away, freely spend idle pleasures in\na placid bed chamber. Then, because of this plight, most\nbeautiful Laodamia, a marriage dearer than life and spirit\nwas taken away from you. A flood, engulfing you in such a\nwhirlpool of love, had carried you off into a deep pit of\ncatastrophe, such as, the Greeks say, drains the floor of\nMount Cyllene, near Pheneus, the swamp having been milled: a\npit which Hercules, falsely fathered, is said once to have\ndug, when the innards of the mountain had fallen, at which\ntime he killed the monsters of Stymphalus with an unerring\narrow under the command of lesser Eurystheus, that the door\nof the heavens might be traversed by more divinities, and\nHebe shortly lose her virginity. But deeper than that pit\nwas your deep love, which, though you were indomitable,\ntaught you to bear the yoke of marriage. And our daughter\ndoes not cherish so dear the head of a late grandson when\nher father is exhausted with age; the grandson, when at long\nlast having acquired his grandfather's riches, enters his\nname in the account books, signed in the presence of a\nwitness, dislodges a vulture from a whitened head the\nimpious joys of a ridiculous distant relative; nor did\nanyone who was the wife of a snow-white cock pigeon rejoice\nso much, a pigeon who is said always to snatch kisses rather\nwantonly from many a biting beak; how especially promiscuous\nis Lesbia! But you alone have conquered their great\npassions, as once and for all you have been united to a fair\nhusband. My sweetheart, compared to Laodamia, is then worthy\nto concede little or nothing to my lap; blond Cupid has\noften gleamed in a saffron yellow tunic, running here and\nthere around her. Although she nevertheless is not satisfied\nwith one Catullus, we bear the infrequent and furtive trysts\nof a chaste mistress, lest we be annoying, in the manner of\nfools. Even Juno, the greatest of the goddesses, often\nstomachs her burning anger at her husband's wrongdoing,\nknowing of more trysts of all-desiring Jupiter. But it isn't\njust to compare people to gods... ...Take the unwelcome\nburden of a trembling father. Besides, she didn't come\nbrought down by my father's right hand to my house, redolent\nwith Oriental fragrance, but gave secret little favors on an\nextraordinary night, when she was removed from the very lap\nof her husband himself. Therefore, it is enough if this day,\nwhich she marks, is given to me with a whiter stone than\nordinary days! Allius Manius, this gift, wrought as well as\nI could in verse, is rendered to you in return for your many\nfavors, lest this day and that touch your name with a\nscabrous blight. To this total, the gods will add so many\nmore gifts, the which Themis once upon a time was accustomed\nto bearing to upright people in ancient times. May you and\nyour life as well be prosperous, and the very house in which\nLesbia and I have played, and Allius, who first has given us\nland and now carries it away, from the tip of whom\neverything good was originated, and my sweetheart, who is\nfar dearer to me than all others, dearer to me than I myself\nam: my life is sweet with her alive.\nTaken with kind permission from Brendan",

soul;\nWherefore as to thy writ :—\"Verona's home for Catullus\nBringeth him shame, for there men of superior mark\nMust on a deserted couch fain chafe their refrigerate limbs:\"\nSuch be no shame (Manius!): rather 'tis matter of ruth.\nPardon me, then, wilt thou an gifts bereft me by grieving\nThese I send not to thee since I avail not present.\nFor, that I own not here abundant treasure of writings\nHas for its cause, in Rome dwell I; and there am I homed,\nThere be my seat, and there my years are gathered to harvest;\nOut of book-cases galore here am I followed by one.\nThis being thus, nill I thou deem 'tis spirit malignant\nActs in such wise or mind lacking of liberal mood\nThat to thy prayer both gifts be not in plenty supplièd:\nWillingly both had I sent, had I the needed supply.\nNor can I (Goddesses!) hide in what things Allius sent me\nAid, forbear to declare what was the aidance he deigned:\nNeither shall fugitive Time from centuries ever oblivious\nVeil in the blinds of night friendship he lavisht on me.\nBut will I say unto you what you shall say to the many\nThousands in turn, and make paper, old crone, to proclaim\n...\nAnd in his death become noted the more and the more,\nNor let spider on high that weaves her delicate webbing\nPractise such labours o'er Allius' obsolete name.\nFor that ye weet right well what care Amathúsia two-faced\nGave me, and how she dasht every hope to the ground,\nWhenas I burnt so hot as burn Trinacria's rocks or\nMallia stream that feeds Œtéan Thermopylae;\nNor did these saddened eyes to be dimmed by assiduous weeping\nCease, and my cheeks with showers ever in sadness be wet.\nE'en as from aëry heights of mountain springeth a springlet\nLimpidest leaping forth from rocking felted with moss,\nThen having headlong rolled the prone-laid valley downpouring,\nPopulous region amid wendeth his gradual way,\nSweetest solace of all to the sweltering traveller wayworn,\nWhenas the heavy heat fissures the fiery fields;\nOr, as to seamen lost in night of whirlwind a-glooming\nGentle of breath there comes fairest and favouring breeze,\nPollux anon being prayed, nor less vows offered to Castor:—\nSuch was the aidance to us Manius pleased to afford.\nHe to my narrow domains far wider limits laid open,\nHe too gave me the house, also he gave me the dame,\nShe upon whom both might exert them, partners in love deeds.\nThither graceful of gait pacing my goddess white-hued\nCame and with gleaming foot on the worn sole of the threshold\nStood she and prest its slab creakihg her sandals the while;\nE'enso with love enflamed in olden days to her helpmate,\nLaodamía the home Protesiléan besought,\nSought, but in vain, for ne'er wi' sacrificial blood shed\nVictims appeased the Lords ruling Celestial seats:\nNever may I so joy in aught (Rhamnusian Virgin!)\nThat I engage in deed maugrè the will of the Lords.\nHow starved altar can crave for gore in piety poured,\nLaodamia learnt taught by the loss of her man,\nDriven perforce to loose the neck of new-wedded help-mate,\nWhenas a winter had gone, nor other winter had come,\nEre in the long dark nights her greeding love was so sated\nThat she had power to live maugrè a marriage broke off,\nWhich, as the Parcae knew, too soon was fated to happen\nShould he a soldier sail bound for those llian walls.\nFor that by Helena's rape, the Champion-leaders of Argives\nUnto herself to incite Troy had already begun,\nTroy (ah, curst be the name) common tomb of Asia and Europe,\nTroy to sad ashes that turned valour and valorous men!\nEke to our brother beloved, destruction ever lamented\nBrought she : 0 Brother for aye lost unto wretchedmost me,\nOh, to thy wretchedmost brother lost the light of his life-tide,\nBuried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house:\nPerisht along wi' thyself forthright all joys we enjoyèd,\nDouce joys fed by thy love during the term of our days;\nWhom now art tombed so far nor 'mid familiar pavestones\nNor wi' thine ashes stored near to thy kith and thy kin,\nBut in that Troy obscene, that Troy of ill-omen, entombèd\nHolds thee, an alien earth-buried in uttermost bourne.\nThither in haste so hot ('tis said) from allwhere the Youth-hood\nGrecian, farèd in hosts forth of their hearths and their homes,\nLest with a stolen punk with fullest of pleasure should Paris\nFairly at leisure and ease sleep in the pacific bed.\nSuch was the hapless chance, most beautiful Laodamia,\nTare fro' thee dearer than life, dearer than spirit itself,\nHim, that husband, whose love in so mighty a whirlpool of passion\nWhelmed thee absorbed and plunged deep in its gulfy abyss,\nE'en as the Grecians tell hard by Phenéus of Cylléne\nDrained was the marish and dried, forming the fattest of soils,\nWhenas in days long done to delve through marrow of mountains\nDaréd, falsing his sire, Amphtryóniades;\nWhat time sure of his shafts he smote Stymphalian monsters\nSlaying their host at the hest dealt by a lord of less worth,\nSo might the gateway of Heaven be trodden by more of the godheads,\nNor might Hébé abide longer to maidenhood doomed.\nYet was the depth of thy love far deeper than deepest of marish\nWhich the hard mistress's yoke taught him so tamely to bear;\nNever was head so dear to a grandsire wasted by life-tide\nWhenas one daughter alone a grandson so tardy had reared,\nWho being found against hope to inherit riches of forbears\nIn the well-witnessed Will haply by name did appear,\nAnd 'spite impious hopes of baffled claimant to kinship\nStartles the Vulturine grip clutching the frost-bitten poll.\nNor with such rapture e'er joyed his mate of snowy-hued plumage\nDove-mate, albeit aye wont in her immoderate heat\nSaid be the bird to snatch hot kisses with beak ever billing,\nAs diddest thou :—yet is Woman multivolent still.\nBut thou 'vailedest alone all these to conquer in love-lowe,\nWhen conjoindd once more unto thy yellow-haired spouse.\nWorthy of yielding to her in naught or ever so little\nCame to the bosom of us she, the fair light of my life,\nRound whom fluttering oft the Love-God hither and thither\nShone with a candid sheen robed in his safflower dress.\nShe though never she bide with one Catullus contented,\nYet will I bear with the rare thefts of my dame the discreet,\nLest over-irk I give which still of fools is the fashion.\nOften did Juno eke Queen of the Heavenly host\nBoil wi' the rabidest rage at dire default of a husband\nLearning the manifold thefts of her omnivolent Jove,\nYet with the Gods mankind 'tis nowise righteous to liken,\n...\nRid me of graceless task fit for a tremulous sire.\nYet was she never to me by hand paternal committed\nWhenas she came to my house reeking Assyrian scents;\nNay, in the darkness of night her furtive favours she deigned me,\nSelf-willed taking herself from very mate's very breast.\nWherefore I hold it enough since given to us and us only\nBoon of that day with Stone whiter than wont she denotes.\nThis to thee—all that I can—this offering couched in verses\n(Allius!) as my return give I for service galore;\nSo wi' the seabriny rust your name may never be sullied\nThis day and that nor yet other and other again.\nHereto add may the Gods all good gifts, which Themis erewhiles\nWont on the pious of old from her full store to bestow:\nBlest be the times of the twain, thyself and she who thy life is,\nAlso the home wherein dallied we, no less the Dame,\nAnser to boot who first of mortals brought us together,\nWhence from beginning all good Fortunes that blest us were born.\nLastly than every else one dearer than self and far dearer,\nLight of my life who alive living to me can endear.",
      "Wikisource": "That you, overwhelmed by fortune and bitter plight, send me this short letter, written down with tears. That I may rescue one shipwrecked, expelled by the frothing waves of the sea, and bring him back in health from the threshold of death, him whom heavenly Venus provides no relief, alone in a celibate bed, in languid sleep, nor Muses delight with sweet song of ancient writers when your mind stays anxiously awake all night, pleases me because you tell me I'm your friend and seek the gifts both of the Muses and of Venus. But lest you not know my misfortunes, Manius, or think I rue my guest's obligation, listen, lest you further seek from a miserable man the blessed gifts wherewith I myself am submerged in the waves of Fortune. At that time when a grown man's toga was first handed down to me, when the age, rife with flowers, issued a pleasant spring, I had played much: the goddess is well aware of us, she who mixes our sweet bitterness with cares. But my brother's death has taken this eager pasttime away from me entirely. My brother, unhappily removed from me, as you were dying, you broke my advantages; my brother, our whole house was buried along with you, and all our joys perished along with you, joys which your kind friendship nurtured in life. Because of untimely death I have expelled from my entire consciousness these pastimes and all delights of the mind. Wherefore, because you write that it is shameful for Catullus to be in Verona, because here, anyone who is anyone would be wont to warm limbs cold from a lonely bed, it is not just a shame, Manius, but a source of real grief. Therefore, please forgive me if I do not grant you the gifts which grief has taken from me, for I cannot so grant them. For, as for the fact that I do not have a great abundance of writings at my family home in Verona, it happens that we live in Rome: that house, that home of mine, there my life is browsed, and one small scroll case out of many follows me here. Since it is so, I wouldn't want you to decide that I'm doing this out of spite or lack of appropriate generosity because an abundance of neither kind of poem has been sent to you though you have sought it. If any such abundance were forthcoming, I would produce it unasked. I cannot keep silent, ye goddesses, about the matter with which Allius has helped me, or about the extent of the obligations with which he has helped me, lest his life, which slips away as the generations forget, cover this zeal with a blind night: but I'll tell you, hereafter tell many thousands and make this roll of papyrus speak when it is old... ... When he is dead, may he become more and more famous, and may no spider do her work, weaving a thin web high upon Allius' lonely name! You know what concern two-faced Venus has given me, and in what manner she has parched me, for I've been burning like Etna's Sicilian crag or the waters of Malis in the hot gates of Mount Oeta, and my hapless eyes have not stopped wasting away in unremitting tears, and my cheeks have not stopped being wet with the gloomy tears of rain. As a stream, shining on the summit of an airy mountain, a stream that rushes forth from the mossy stone, cuts through the way of a dense population and suddenly rolls from a sloping valley is sweet comfort to a tired, sweaty traveler when severely hot weather cracks the parched fields, and precisely as a second wind that comes blowing rather gently is sweet comfort after sailors have been buffeted about in a black tornado, such help has Allius been to me, now that the prayers of Castor and Pollux have been issued. With a wide path, he has opened up a shut plain, and he has given a home to me and to Lesbia, to which she and I would come to ply our mutual love. My radiant goddess brought herself fleetly to Allius' home and set her foot's gleaming sole in the worn doorway, her weight balanced on a squeaky sandal, as Laodamia, burning with love, once came to the house of her husband Protesilaus, a house begun in vain, since no sacrificial animal had yet appeased the heavenly masters with its holy blood. Nemesis, nothing of the sort that is undertaken recklessly, when the gods are unwilling, would please me so very much. Laodamia learned how the hungry altar longed for upright blood when her husband was taken away, and she was compelled to let go of her new husband's neck before the return of winter had satisfied her passionate love in the long nights, with the result that she was able to live after breaking off the marriage, which the Fates knew would not be a long way off if he went as a soldier to Troy. At that time, with the abduction of Helen, Troy had begun to rouse the chief men of the Argives toward herself, Troy (horror!), shared tomb of Asia and Europe, Troy, cruel funeral pyre of all men and virtues, which has even brought a miserable death to my brother! Our whole house has been buried together with you, and all our joys have perished together with you, which your sweet friendship nurtured in life. A foreign land holds him deep under ground now, so far away, not among familiar tombs, and not placed beside the ashes of relatives, but buried unhappily in Troy, loathsome Troy! Whither, then, the conscripted men of Greece, hurrying from all directions to forsake their domestic hearths, are drawn, lest Paris, having rejoiced after Helen was enticed away, freely spend idle pleasures in a placid bed chamber. Then, because of this plight, most beautiful Laodamia, a marriage dearer than life and spirit was taken away from you. A flood, engulfing you in such a whirlpool of love, had carried you off into a deep pit of catastrophe, such as, the Greeks say, drains the floor of Mount Cyllene, near Pheneus, the swamp having been milled: a pit which Hercules, falsely fathered, is said once to have dug, when the innards of the mountain had fallen, at which time he killed the monsters of Stymphalus with an unerring arrow under the command of lesser Eurystheus, that the door of the heavens might be traversed by more divinities, and Hebe shortly lose her virginity. But deeper than that pit was your deep love, which, though you were indomitable, taught you to bear the yoke of marriage. And our daughter does not cherish so dear the head of a late grandson when her father is exhausted with age; the grandson, when at long last having acquired his grandfather's riches, enters his name in the account books, signed in the presence of a witness, dislodges a vulture from a whitened head the impious joys of a ridiculous distant relative; nor did anyone who was the wife of a snow-white cock pigeon rejoice so much, a pigeon who is said always to snatch kisses rather wantonly from many a biting beak; how especially promiscuous is Lesbia! But you alone have conquered their great passions, as once and for all you have been united to a fair husband. My sweetheart, compared to Laodamia, is then worthy to concede little or nothing to my lap; blond Cupid has often gleamed in a saffron yellow tunic, running here and there around her. Although she nevertheless is not satisfied with one Catullus, we bear the infrequent and furtive trysts of a chaste mistress, lest we be annoying, in the manner of fools. Even Juno, the greatest of the goddesses, often stomachs her burning anger at her husband's wrongdoing, knowing of more trysts of all-desiring Jupiter. But it isn't just to compare people to gods... ...Take the unwelcome burden of a trembling father. Besides, she didn't come brought down by my father's right hand to my house, redolent with Oriental fragrance, but gave secret little favors on an extraordinary night, when she was removed from the very lap of her husband himself. Therefore, it is enough if this day, which she marks, is given to me with a whiter stone than ordinary days! Allius Manius, this gift, wrought as well as I could in verse, is rendered to you in return for your many favors, lest this day and that touch your name with a scabrous blight. To this total, the gods will add so many more gifts, the which Themis once upon a time was accustomed to bearing to upright people in ancient times. May you and your life as well be prosperous, and the very house in which Lesbia and I have played, and Allius, who first has given us land and now carries it away, from the tip of whom everything good was originated, and my sweetheart, who is far dearer to me than all others, dearer to me than I myself am: my life is sweet with her alive.",
      "PoetryinTranslation": "That you send this letter to me, written with tears,\nto me, crushed by fate and bitter ill-fortune,\nthat I might raise up, and return from the threshold of death\none shipwrecked, cast from the foaming waves of the sea,\none whom sacred Venus deprives of gentle sleep,\nforsaken, enduring an empty bed, not delighting\nin the sweet songs of the Muse of the ancient poets,\nlying awake all night with an anxious mind:\nthat’s pleasing to me, since you call me your friend,\nand search here for the gifts of the Muses and Venus.\nBut in case my troubles aren’t known to you, Manlius ,\nor you think I dislike the duties of a friend,\nlet me tell of waves of misfortune that I myself plunge in,\nlest you seek rich gifts any more from a wretched man.\nAt that time when the first white toga was handed me,\nwhen my youth passed in flower through happy spring,\nI played more than enough: the goddess was not unknown to me,\nthe work that mixed bitter with sweet.\nBut all my studies were lost in the grief at my brother’s death.\nO wretched, to take my brother from me:\nyou brother, you, in dying, wrecked my good fortune,\nwith you our whole house is buried together,\nwith you all our joys perish in one,\nthat your love nourished in sweet life.\nSo that ruined in thought I forsake those studies\nand all the delights of the mind.\nTherefore, when you say that it’s shameful for Catullus\nto be in Verona, that here someone well-known\nonly warms cold limbs in an empty bed,\nit’s not shameful, Manlius, my sadness is great.\nSo pardon me if I don’t bestow those gifts on you\nthat grief takes from me, while I cannot.\nSince there’s no great store of books here with me,\nit needs me to be living in Rome: there’s my house,\nthere’s my place, there my time is spent:\nonly one of my many book-boxes follows me here.\nsince it’s so, don’t think I do anything with ill intent,\nor that I’m lacking at all in noble feeling:\nit’s on you and no other I seek to lavish riches:\nbesides I’d offer whatever riches I had.\nI can’t conceal, goddesses, the things of mine\nAllius helped with, or how many services he’s performed,\nlest fleeting time in forgetful ages\nhides this kindness of his in blind night:\nbut I tell it to you: speak to many future thousands\nand let this paper speak in its old age,\nand let the dead become more and more famous,\ndon’t let the spider spinning its fine web on high\nperform its task on Allius’s neglected name.\nFor you know how fickle Venus would have troubled me,\nand in what way she might have scorched me,\nwhen I might have burned like the Sicilian rocks,\nor the waters of Malis at Oetaean Thermopylae ,\nmy grieving eyes not have ceased to melt with endless tears,\nmy cheeks to have been drenched with a saddened rain.\nThen like a mountain stream shining on airy heights,\nspringing from mossy rock, that, having fallen\nheadlong from sloping valleys, passes\nthrough the midst of densely populated regions,\nsweet comfort to travellers’ weary labour,\nwhen fierce heat splits the dried-up fields:\nlike to a favourable wind that comes breathing lightly\nto the sailor tossed in the black tempest,\nnow praying to Pollux , now imploring Castor ,\nsuch was Allius’s help to me.\nHe opened the closed field with a wide path,\nand granted my self and my girl a house,\nwhere we carried on our mutual affair,\nto which my bright goddess repaired\nwith gentle steps, set her graceful sandals\non the worn threshold, rested her shining feet,\nas once with blazing passion Laodamia came\nto the house, begun in vain, of Protesilaus\nher husband, the sacrifice not yet appeasing\nthe gods’ love of sacred blood.\nLet nothing please me much, Fate, Ramnusian Virgin,\nthat you by chance may receive unwillingly.\nLaodamia learnt from the loss of her husband\nhow the hungry altar desires holy blood:\nshe was forced to loose her new spouse’s neck,\nbefore one winter, and another returning,\nhad sated eager love with their long nights,\nso she might learn to live without a lost husband,\nwhom the Fates knew would not live long\nif he went as a soldier to the walls of Troy .\nFor now Helen ’s abduction had forced\nthe Greek nobles to rouse their men for Troy,\nTroy (the evil!) a common grave for Asia and Europe,\nTroy the bitter ruin of men and of all virtue,\nhave you not even brought my brother’s death.\nOh alas for the brother taken from me,\noh alas the shining light of a brother lost,\nwith you our whole house is buried together,\nwith you all our joys perish in one,\nthat your love nourished in sweet life.\nYou who, far away, are not interred among famous tombs,\nnor near the ashes of the known,\nbut vile Troy, unhappy Troy, holds your grave,\nin the furthest soil of an alien land.\nTo which they say the men of Greece hurried\nfrom every side, deserting their household shrines,\nlest Paris , delighted, carried off at leisure,\nto a peaceful bed, the adulteress he’d abducted.\nThrough your misfortune, then, loveliest Laodamia\nyour husband was taken from you, dearer to you\nthan life and spirit: love’s passion, swallowing you\nin a whirlpool, carried you into the steep abyss,\nas they say the soil of Greek Pheneus near Cyllene\ndried up, when the thick swamp was drained,\nthat Hercules , the divinely-fathered, once dared to lance,\nin the hacked out marrow of the mountains,\nwhen his sure arrows struck the Stymphalian birds,\nat a worse master’s command, so that the threshold\nof the heavens might be frequented by more gods,\nand Hebe might not long remain a virgin.\nBut your deep love, that taught an untamed girl\nto bear the yoke, was deeper still than that abyss.\nSince the grandchild nursed by an only daughter,\nis not as dear to her father, child of his old age,\nthat, when the child’s name  is barely entered\nin the grandfather’s will, disposing of his riches,\nremoving the scornful family’s impious joy,\nscatters the vultures from his white head:\nno spouse was ever as pleasing to a white dove,\nthat they say often sinfully gives far more kisses\nnipping with its beak, than any woman\nwho beyond measure longs for as much.\nBut you alone outdo their great passion,\nyou who are won for ever by a golden-haired man.\nYou to whom the light of my life conceded little\nor nothing in worth, when she gave herself\ninto my lap, who often shone, with Cupid\nrunning about her, bright in his saffron tunic.\nEven if she’s still not content with Catullus alone,\nI’ll suffer the infrequent affairs of a shy mistress,\nlest I’m too annoying in the manner of fools.\nOften even Juno , greatest of goddesses,\nswallows her burning anger with her spouse’s sins,\nknowing the many affairs of all-willing Jupiter .\nAnd men are not to be compared with the gods,\nbear the thankless burden of a worried father.\nYet, led by no father’s hand, she comes to me,\nto the house, fragrant with Assyrian perfumes,\nbrings me the marvellous gift in the secret night,\nshe herself, stolen away from her husband’s breast.\nAnd that is enough, if that alone’s granted to me,\nthat she marks out that day with a brighter light.\nThis then Allius, for you, what I can, a gift\nmade of song, in return for your friendship,\nlest this day and that, and others on others\ntouch your name with corrosions of rust.\nAnd let the gods add more to this, those gifts\nThemis once used to bring to the pious of old.\nMay you be happy, both you and your life,\nboth your house in which we joyed, and the lady,\nand he who first gave you to me,\nfrom which source all our good was born, and she,\nbefore everything, dearer to me than him, light of my life,\nthrough whose being alive, living is sweet to me."

All this is great, but he himself is the greatest of all, not a man, but actually a massive erect penis.",
      "PoetryinTranslation": "Mentula ’s good for thirty acres of meadows,\nforty of fields: the rest of it’s marsh.\nWhy shouldn’t he exceed Croesus in riches,\none who possesses so many assets, in land,\nmeadows, fields, vast woods and pastures and pools\nas far as the Hyperboreans , and Ocean ’s seas?\nAll this is great, but he’s the greatest of all,\nnot a man, but, in truth, a great projecting Cock."
