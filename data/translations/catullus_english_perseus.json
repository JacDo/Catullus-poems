man's grief and gladness commingling,\nYou too of Golgos Queen and Lady of leafy\nIdalium\n,\nWhelm'd you in what manner waves that maiden fantasy-fired,\nAll for a blond-haired youth suspiring many a singulf!\nWhiles how dire was the dread she dreed in languishing heart-strings;\nHow yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she paled!\nWhenas yearning to mate his might with the furious monster\nTheseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.\nThen of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,\nPromise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.\nFor as an oak that shakes on topmost summit of Taurus\nIts boughs, or cone-growing pine from bole bark resin exuding,\nWhirlwind of passing might that twists the stems with its storm-blasts,\nUproots, deracinates, forthright its trunk to the farthest,\nProne falls, shattering wide what lies in line of its downfall,—\nThus was that wildling flung by Theseus and vanquisht of body,\nVainly tossing its horns and goring the wind to no purpose.\nThence with abounding praise returned he, guiding his footsteps,\nWhile a fine drawn thread checked steps in wander abounding,\nLest when issuing forth of the winding maze labyrinthine\nBaffled become his track by inobservable error.\nBut for what cause should I, from early subject digressing,\nTell of the daughter who the face of her sire unseeing,\nEke her sister's embrace nor less her mother's endearments,\nWho in despair bewept her hapless child that so gladly\nChose before every and each the lively wooing of Theseus?\nOr how borne by the ship to the yeasting shore-line of Dia\nCame she? or how when bound her eyes in bondage of slumber\nLeft her that chosen mate with mind unmindful departing?\nOften (they tell) with heart inflamed by fiery fury\nPoured she shrilling of shrieks from deepest depths of her bosom;\nNow she would sadly scale the broken faces of mountains,\nWhence she might overglance the boundless boiling of billows,\nThen she would  rush to bestem the salt-plain's quivering wavelet\nAnd from her ankles bare the dainty garment uplifting,\nSpoke she these words ('tis said) from sorrow's deepest abysses,\nWhile from her tear-drencht face outburst cold shivering sobs.\n\"Thus from my patrial shore, O traitor, hurried to exile,\nMe on a lonely strand hast left, perfidious Theseus?\nThus wise farest, despite the godhead of Deities spurned,\n(Reckless, alas!) to your home convoying perjury-curses?\nNaught, then, ever availed that mind of cruelest counsel\nAlter? No saving grace in you was evermore ready,\nThat to have pity on me vouchsafed your pitiless bosom?\nNevertheless not in past time such were the promises wordy\nLavished; nor such hopes to me the hapless were bidden;\nBut the glad married joys, the longed-for pleasures of wedlock.\nAll now empty and vain, by breath of the breezes bescattered!\nNow, let woman no more trust her to man when he sweareth,\nNe'er let her hope to find or truth or faith in his pleadings,\nWho when lustful thought forelooks to somewhat attaining,\nNever an oath they fear, shall spare no promise to promise.\nYet no sooner they sate all lewdness and lecherous fancy,\nNothing remember of words and reck they naught of fore-swearing.\nCertes, you did I snatch from midmost whirlpool of ruin\nDeadly, and held it cheap loss of a brother to suffer\nRather than fail your need (O false!) at hour the supremest.\nTherefore my limbs are doomed to be torn of birds, and of ferals\nPrey, nor shall upheapt Earth afford a grave to my body.\nSay me, what lioness bare you 'neath lone rock of the desert?\nWhat sea spued you conceived from out the spume of his surges!\nWhat manner Syrt, what ravening Scylla, what vasty Charybdis?\nyou who for sweet life saved such meeds are lief of returning!\nIf never willed your breast with me to mate you in marriage,\nHating the savage law decreed by primitive parent,\nStill of your competence 'twas within your household to home me,\nWhere I might serve as slave in gladsome service familiar,\nLaving your snow-white feet in clearest chrystalline waters\nOr with its purpling gear your couch in company strewing.\nYet for what cause should I complain in vain to the winds that unknow me,\n(I so beside me with grief!) which ne'er of senses endued\nHear not the words sent forth nor aught avail they to answer?\nNow be his course well-nigh engaged in midway of ocean,\nNor any mortal shape appears in barrens of sea-wrack.\nThus at the latest hour with insults over-sufficient\nE'en to my plaints fere Fate begrudges ears that would hear me.\nJupiter\n! Lord of All-might, Oh would in days that are bygone\nNe'er had Cecropian poops toucht ground at Gnossian foreshore,\nNor to the unconquered Bull that tribute direful conveying\nHad the false Seaman bound to Cretan island his hawser,\nNor had yon evil wight, 'neath shape the softest hard purpose\nHiding, enjoyed repose within our mansion beguested!\nWhither can wend I now? What hope lends help to the lost one?\nIdomenean mounts shall I scale? Ah, parted by whirlpools\nWidest, yon truculent main where yields it power of passage?\nAid of my sire can I crave? Whom I willing abandoned,\nTreading in tracks of a youth bewrayed with blood of a brother!\nCan I console my soul with the helpful love of a helpmate\nWho flies me with pliant oars, flies overbounding the sea-depths?\nNay, if this Coast I quit, this lone isle lends me no roof-tree,\nNor aught issue allows begirt by billows of Ocean:\nNowhere is path for flight: none hope shows: all things are silent:\nAll be a desolate waste: all makes display of destruction.\nYet never close these eyes in latest languor of dying,\nNe'er from my wearied frame go forth slow-ebbing my senses,\nEre from the Gods just doom implore I, treason-betrayed,\nAnd with my breath supreme firm faith of Celestials invoke I.\nTherefore, O you who 'venge man's deed with penalties direful,\nEumenides! aye wont to bind with viperous hairlocks\nForeheads,—Oh, deign outspeak fierce wrath from bosom outbreathing,\nHither, Oh hither, speed, and lend you all ear to my grievance,\nWhich now sad I (alas!) outpour from innermost vitals\nMaugre my will, sans help, blind, fired with furious madness.\nAnd, as indeed all spring from veriest core of my bosom,\nSuffer you not the cause of grief and woe to evanish;\nBut with the Will wherewith could Theseus leave me in loneness,\nGoddesses! bid that Will lead him, lead his, to destruction.\"\nE'en as she thus poured forth these words from anguish of bosom,\nAnd for this cruel deed, distracted, sued she for vengeance,\nNodded the Ruler of Gods Celestial, matchless of All-might,\nWhen at the gest earth-plain and horrid spaces of ocean\nTrembled, and every sphere rockt stars and planets resplendent.\nMeanwhile Theseus himself, obscured in blindness of darkness\nAs to his mind, dismiss'd from breast oblivious all things\nErewhile enjoined and held hereto in memory constant,\nNor for his saddened sire the gladness-signals uphoisting\nHeralded safe return within sight of the Erechthean harbour.\nFor 'twas told of yore, when from walls of the Virginal Deess\nAegeus speeding his son, to the care of breezes committed,\nThus with a last embrace to the youth spoke words of commandment:\n\"Son! far nearer my heart (you alone) than life of the longest,\nSon, I perforce dismiss to doubtful, dangerous chances,\nLately restored to me when eld draws nearest his ending,\nSince such fortune in me, and in you such boiling of valour\nTear you away from me so loath, whose eyes in their languor\nNever are sated with sight of my son, all-dearest of figures.\nNor will I send you forth with joy that gladdens my bosom,\nNor will I suffer you show boon signs of favouring Fortune,\nBut from my soul I'll first express an issue of sorrow,\nSoiling my hoary hairs with dust and ashes commingled;\nThen will I hang stained sails fast-made to the wavering yard-arms,\nSo shall our mourning thought and burning torture of spirit\nShow by the dark sombre-dye of Iberian canvas spread.\nBut, grant me the grace Who dwells in Sacred Itone,\n(And our issue to guard and ward the seats of Erechtheus\nSware She) that if your right is besprent with blood of the Man-Bull,\nThen do you so-wise act, and stored in memory's heart-core\nDwell these mandates of me, no time their traces untracing.\nDip, when first shall arise our hills to gladden your eye-glance,\nDown from your every mast the ill-omened vestments of mourning,\nThen let the twisten ropes upheave the whitest of canvas,\nWherewith splendid shall gleam the tallest spars of the top-mast,\nThese seeing sans delay with joy exalting my spirit\nWell shall I wot boon Time sets you returning before me.\"\nSuch were the mandates which stored at first in memory constant\nFaded from Theseus' mind like mists, compelled by the whirlwind,\nFleet from aerial crests of mountains hoary with snow-drifts.\nBut as the sire had sought the citadel's summit for outlook,\nWasting his anxious eyes with tear-floods evermore flowing,\nForthright e'en as he saw the sail-gear darkened with dye-stain,\nHeadlong himself flung he from the sea-cliff's pinnacled summit\nHolding his Theseus lost by doom of pitiless Fortune.\nThus as he came to the home funest, his roof-tree paternal,\nTheseus (vaunting the death), what dule to the maiden of Minos\nDealt with unminding mind so dree'd he similar dolour.\nShe too gazing in grief at the kelson vanishing slowly,\nSelf-wrapt, manifold cares revolved in spirit perturbed.\nON ANOTHER PART OF THE COVERLET\nBut from the further side came flitting bright-faced Iacchus\nGirded by Satyr-crew and Nysa-reared Sileni\nBurning with love unto thee (Ariadne!) and greeting thy presence.\n...\nWho flocking eager to fray did rave with infuriate spirit,\n\"Evoe\" frenzying loud, with heads at \"Evoe” rolling.\nBrandisht some of the maids their thyrsi sheathed of spear-point,\nSome snatcht limbs and joints of sturlings rended to pieces,\nThese girt necks and waists with writhing bodies of vipers,\nThose with the gear enwombed in crates dark orgies ordained—\nOrgies that ears profane must vainly lust for o'er hearing—\nOthers with palms on high smote hurried strokes on the cymbal,\nOr from the polisht brass woke thin-toned tinkling music,\nWhile from the many there boomed and blared hoarse blast of the horn-trump,\nAnd with its horrid skirl loud shrilled the barbarous bag-pipe\nShowing such varied forms, that richly-decorated couch-cloth\nFolded in strait embrace the bedding drapery-veiled.\nThis when the Thessalan youths had eyed with eager inspection\nFulfilled, place they began to provide for venerate Godheads,\nEven as Zephyrus' breath, seas couching placid at dawn-tide,\nRoughens, then stings and spurs the wavelets slantingly fretted—\nRising Aurora the while 'neath Sol the wanderer's threshold—\nTardy at first they flow by the clement breathing of breezes\nUrged, and echo the shores with soft-toned ripples of laughter,\nBut as the winds wax high so waves wax higher and higher,\nFlashing and floating afar to outswim morn's purpurine splendours,—\nSo did the crowd fare forth, the royal vestibule leaving,\nAnd to their house each wight with vaguing paces departed.\nAfter their wending, the first, foremost from\nPelion\n's summit,\nChiron came to the front with woodland presents surcharged:\nWhatso of blooms and flowers bring forth Thessalian uplands\nMighty with mountain crests, whate'er of riverine lea flowers\nReareth Favonius' air, bud-breeding, tepidly breathing,\nAll in his hands brought he, unseparate in woven garlands,\nWhereat laughed the house as soothed by pleasure of perfume.\nPresently Péneus appears, deserting verdurous\nTempe\n—\nTempe\ngirt by her belts of greenwood ever impending,\nLeft for the Mamonides with frequent dances to worship—\nNor is he empty of hand, for bears he tallest of beeches\nDeracinate, and bays with straight boles lofty and stately,\nNot without nodding plane-tree nor less the flexible sister\nFire-slain Phaëton left, and not without cypresses airy.\nThese in a line wide-broke set he, the Mansion surrounding,\nSo by the soft leaves screened, the porch might flourish in verdure.\nFollows hard on his track with active spirit Prometheus,\nBearing extenuate sign of penalties suffer'd in by-gones.\nPaid erewhiles what time fast-bound as to every member,\nHung he in carkanet slung from the Scythian rocktor.\nLast did the Father of Gods with his sacred spouse and his offspring,\nProud from the Heavens proceed, thee leaving (Phoebus) in loneness,\nLone wi' thy sister twin who haunteth mountains of Idrus:\nFor that the Virgin spurned as thou the person of Peleus,\nNor Thetis' nuptial torch would greet by act of her presence.\nWhen they had leaned their limbs upon snowy benches reposing,\nTables largely arranged with various viands were garnisht.\nBut, ere opened the feast, with infirm gesture their semblance\nShaking, the Parcae fell to chaunting veridique verses.\nRobed were their tremulous frames all o'er in muffle of garments\nBright-white, purple of hem enfolding heels in its edges;\nSnowy the fillets that bound heads aged by many a year-tide,\nAnd, as their wont aye was, their hands plied labour unceasing.\nEach in her left upheld with soft fleece clothed a distaff,\nThen did the right that drew forth thread with upturn of fingers\nGently fashion the yarn which deftly twisted by thumb-ball\nSpeeded the spindle poised by thread-whorl perfect of polish;\nThus as the work was wrought, the lengths were trimmed wi' the fore-teeth,\nWhile to their thin, dry lips stuck wool-flecks severed by biting,\nWhich at the first outstood from yarn-hanks evenly fine-drawn.\nStill at their feet in front soft fleece-flecks white as the snow-flake\nLay in the trusty guard of wickers woven in withies.\nAlways a-carding the wool, with clear-toned voices resounding\nTold they such lots as these in song divinely directed,\nChaunts which none after-time shall 'stablish falsehood-convicted.\n1.\nO who by virtues great all highmost  honours enhancest,\nGuard of Emáthia-land, most famous made by thine offspring,\nTake what the Sisters deign this gladsome day to disclose thee,\nOracles soothfast told,—And ye, by Destiny followed,\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n2.\nSoon to thy sight shall rise, their fond hopes bringing to bridegrooms,\nHesperus\n: soon shall come thy spouse with planet auspicious,\nWho shall thy mind enbathe with a love that softens the spirit,\nAnd as thyself shall prepare for sinking in languorous slumber,\nUnder thy neck robust, soft arms dispreading as pillow.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n3.\nNever a house like this such loves as these hath united,\nNever did love conjoin by such-like covenant lovers,\nAs th'according tie Thetis deigned in concert wi' Peleus.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n4.\nBorn of yon twain shall come Achilles guiltless of fear-sense,\nKnown by his forceful breast and ne'er by back to the foeman,\nWho shall at times full oft in doubtful contest of race-course\nConquer the fleet-foot doe with slot-tracks smoking and burning.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n5.\nNone shall with him compare, howe'er war-doughty a hero,\nWhenas the Phrygian rills flow deep with bloodshed of Teucer,\nAnd beleaguering the walls of\nTroy\nwith longest of warfare\nHe shall the works lay low, third heir of Pelops the perjured.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n6.\nHis be the derring-do and deeds of valour egregious,\nOften mothers shall own at funeral-rites of their children,\nWhat time their hoary hairs from head in ashes are loosened,\nAnd wi' their hands infirm thay smite their bosoms loose duggèd.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n7.\nFor as the toiling hind bestrewing denseness of corn-stalks\nUnder the broiling sun mows grain-fields yellow to harvest,\nSo shall his baneful brand strew earth with corpses of Troy-born.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n8.\nAye to his valorous worth attest shall wave of Scamander\nWhich unto Hellè-Sea fast flowing ever dischargeth,\nStraiter whose course shall grow by up-heaped barrage of corpses,\nWhile in his depths runs warm his stream with slaughter commingled.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n9.\nWitness in fine shall be the victim rendered to death-stroke,\nWhenas the earthern tomb on lofty tumulus builded\nShall of the stricken maid receive limbs white as the snow-flake.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n10.\nFor when at last shall Fors to weary Achaians her fiat\nDeal, of Dardanus-town to burst Neptunian fetters,\nThen shall the high-reared tomb stand bathed with Polyxena's life-blood,\nWho, as the victim doomed to fall by the double-edged falchion,\nForward wi' hams relaxt shall smite a body beheaded.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n11.\nWherefore arise, ye pair, conjoin loves ardently longed-for,\nNow doth the groom receive with happiest omen his goddess,\nNow let the bride at length to her yearning spouse be delivered.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\n12.\nNeither the nurse who comes at dawn to visit her nursling\nE'er shall avail her neck to begird with yesterday's ribband.\n[Speed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 spindles.]\nNor shall the mother's soul for ill-matcht daughter a-grieving\nLose by a parted couch all hopes of favourite grandsons.\nSpeed ye, the well-spun woof out-drawing, speed ye, 0 Spindles.\nThus in the bygone day Peleus' fate foretelling\nChaunted from breasts divine prophetic verse the Parcae.\nFor that the pure chaste homes of heroes to visit in person\nOft-tide the Gods, and themselves to display where mortals were gathered,\nWont were the Heavenlies while none human piety spurned.\nOften the Deities' Sire, in fulgent temple a-dwelling,\nWhenas in festal days received he his annual worship,\nLooked upon hundreds of bulls felled prone on pavement before him.\nFull oft Liber who roamed from topmost peak of\nParnassus\nHunted his howling host, his Thyiads with tresses dishevelled.\nThen with contending troops from all their city outflocking\nGladly the Delphians hailed their God with smoking of altars.\nOften in death-full war and bravest of battle, or Mavors\nOr rapid Triton's Queen or eke the Virgin Rhamnusian,\nBevies of weaponed men exhorting, proved their presence.\nBut from the time when earth was stained with unspeakable scandals\nAnd forth fro' greeding breasts of all men justice departed,\nThen did the brother drench his hands in brotherly bloodshed,\nStinted the son in heart to mourn decease of his parents,\nLongèd the sire to sight his first-born's funeral convoy\nSo more freely the flower of step-dame-maiden to rifle;\nAfter that impious Queen her guiltless son underlying,\nImpious, the household gods with crime ne'er dreading to sully—\nAll things fair and nefand being mixt in fury of evil\nTurned from ourselves avert the great goodwill of the Godheads.\nWherefor they nowise deign our human assemblies to visit,\nNor do they suffer themselves be met in light of the day-tide."

Grant Chalybon perish the whole of the race,\nEke who in primal times ore seeking under the surface\nShowed th' example, and spalled iron however so hard.\nShortly before I was shorn my sister tresses bewailèd\nLot of me, e'en as the sole brother to Memnon the Black,\nWinnowing upper air wi' feathers flashing and quiv'ring,\nChloris' wing-borne steed, came before Arsinoë,\nWhence upraising myself he flies through aëry shadows,\nAnd in chaste Venus' breast drops he the present he bears.\nEke Zephyritis had sent, for the purpose trusted, her bondsman,\nSettler of Grecian strain on the Canopian strand.\nSo willed various Gods, lest sole 'mid lights of the Heavens\nShould Ariadne's crown taken from temples of her\nGlitter in gold, but we not less shine fulgent in splendour,\nWe the consecrate spoils shed by a blond-hued head,\nEven as weeping-wet sought I the fanes of Celestials\nPlaced me the Goddess a new light amid star-lights of old:\nFor with Virgo in touch and joining the furious Lion's\nRadiance with Callisto, maid of Lyc´on beloved,\nWind I still to the west, conducting tardy Boötes,\nWho unwilling and slow must into Ocean merge.\nYet though press me o'night the pacing footprints of Godheads,\nTethys, hoary of hair, ever regains me by day.\n(Lend me thy leave to speak such words, Rhamnusian Virgin,\nVerities like unto these never in fear will I veil;\nAlbeit every star asperse me with enemy's censure,\nSecrets in soothfast heart hoarded perforce I reveal.)\nNowise gladdens me so this state as absence torments me,\nAbsence doomëd for aye ta'en fro' my mistress's head,\nWhere I was wont (though she such cares unknew in her girlhood)\nMany a thousand scents, Syrian unguents, to sip.\nNow do you pair conjoined by the longed-for light of the torches,\nEarlier yield not selves unto unanimous wills\nNor wi' the dresses doft your barèd nipples encounter,\nEre shall yon onyx-vase pour me libations glad,\nOnyx yours, ye that seek only rights of virtuous bed-rite.\nBut who yieldeth herself unto advowtry impure,\nAh! may her loathed gifts in light dust uselessly soak,\nFor of unworthy sprite never a gift I desire.\nRather, 0 new-mated brides, be concord aye your companion,\nEver let constant love dwell in the dwellings of you.\nYet when thou sightest, 0 Queen, the Constellations, I pray thee,\nEvery festal day Venus the Goddess appease;\nNor of thy unguent-gifts allow myself to be lacking,\nNay, do thou rather add largeliest increase to boons.\nWould but the stars down fall! Could I of my Queen be the hair-lock,\nNeighbour to Hydrochois e'en let Oarion shine."

    "text": "To MANIUS ON VARIOUS MATTERS.\nWhen to me sore opprest by bitter chance of misfortune\nThis thy letter thou send'st written wi' blotting of tears,\nSo might I save thee flung by spuming billows of ocean,\nShipwreckt, rescuing life snatcht from the threshold of death;\nEke neither Venus the Holy to rest in slumber's refreshment\nGrants thee her grace on couch lying deserted and lone,\nNor can the Muses avail with dulcet song of old writers\nEver delight thy mind sleepless in anxious care;\nGrateful be this to my thought since thus thy friend I'm entitled,\nHence of me seekest thou gifts Muses and Venus can give:\nBut that bide not unknown to thee my sorrows (0 Manius!)\nAnd lest office of host I should be holden to hate,\nLearn how in Fortune's deeps I chance myself to be drownèd,\nNor fro' the poor rich boons furthermore prithee require.\nWhat while first to myself the pure-white garment was given,\nWhenas my flowery years flowed in fruition of spring,\nMuch I disported enow, nor 'bode I a stranger to Goddess\nWho with our cares is lief sweetness of bitter to mix:\nYet did a brother's death pursuits like these to my sorrow\nBid for me cease: Oh, snatcht brother! from wretchedest me.\nThen, yea, thou by thy dying hast broke my comfort, 0 brother;\nBuried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house;\nPerisht along wi' thyself all gauds and joys of our life-tide,\nDouce love fostered by thee during the term of our days.\nAfter thy doom of death fro' mind I banishèd wholly\nStudies like these, and all lending a solace to soul;\nWherefore as to thy writ :—\"Verona's home for Catullus\nBringeth him shame, for there men of superior mark\nMust on a deserted couch fain chafe their refrigerate limbs:\"\nSuch be no shame (Manius!): rather 'tis matter of ruth.\nPardon me, then, wilt thou an gifts bereft me by grieving\nThese I send not to thee since I avail not present.\nFor, that I own not here abundant treasure of writings\nHas for its cause, in Rome dwell I; and there am I homed,\nThere be my seat, and there my years are gathered to harvest;\nOut of book-cases galore here am I followed by one.\nThis being thus, nill I thou deem 'tis spirit malignant\nActs in such wise or mind lacking of liberal mood\nThat to thy prayer both gifts be not in plenty supplièd:\nWillingly both had I sent, had I the needed supply.\nNor can I (Goddesses!) hide in what things Allius sent me\nAid, forbear to declare what was the aidance he deigned:\nNeither shall fugitive Time from centuries ever oblivious\nVeil in the blinds of night friendship he lavisht on me.\nBut will I say unto you what you shall say to the many\nThousands in turn, and make paper, old crone, to proclaim\n...\nAnd in his death become noted the more and the more,\nNor let spider on high that weaves her delicate webbing\nPractise such labours o'er Allius' obsolete name.\nFor that ye weet right well what care Amathúsia two-faced\nGave me, and how she dasht every hope to the ground,\nWhenas I burnt so hot as burn Trinacria's rocks or\nMallia stream that feeds Œtéan Thermopylae;\nNor did these saddened eyes to be dimmed by assiduous weeping\nCease, and my cheeks with showers ever in sadness be wet.\nE'en as from aëry heights of mountain springeth a springlet\nLimpidest leaping forth from rocking felted with moss,\nThen having headlong rolled the prone-laid valley downpouring,\nPopulous region amid wendeth his gradual way,\nSweetest solace of all to the sweltering traveller wayworn,\nWhenas the heavy heat fissures the fiery fields;\nOr, as to seamen lost in night of whirlwind a-glooming\nGentle of breath there comes fairest and favouring breeze,\nPollux anon being prayed, nor less vows offered to Castor:—\nSuch was the aidance to us Manius pleased to afford.\nHe to my narrow domains far wider limits laid open,\nHe too gave me the house, also he gave me the dame,\nShe upon whom both might exert them, partners in love deeds.\nThither graceful of gait pacing my goddess white-hued\nCame and with gleaming foot on the worn sole of the threshold\nStood she and prest its slab creakihg her sandals the while;\nE'enso with love enflamed in olden days to her helpmate,\nLaodamía the home Protesiléan besought,\nSought, but in vain, for ne'er wi' sacrificial blood shed\nVictims appeased the Lords ruling Celestial seats:\nNever may I so joy in aught (Rhamnusian Virgin!)\nThat I engage in deed maugrè the will of the Lords.\nHow starved altar can crave for gore in piety poured,\nLaodamia learnt taught by the loss of her man,\nDriven perforce to loose the neck of new-wedded help-mate,\nWhenas a winter had gone, nor other winter had come,\nEre in the long dark nights her greeding love was so sated\nThat she had power to live maugrè a marriage broke off,\nWhich, as the Parcae knew, too soon was fated to happen\nShould he a soldier sail bound for those llian walls.\nFor that by Helena's rape, the Champion-leaders of Argives\nUnto herself to incite Troy had already begun,\nTroy (ah, curst be the name) common tomb of Asia and Europe,\nTroy to sad ashes that turned valour and valorous men!\nEke to our brother beloved, destruction ever lamented\nBrought she : 0 Brother for aye lost unto wretchedmost me,\nOh, to thy wretchedmost brother lost the light of his life-tide,\nBuried together wi' thee lieth the whole of our house:\nPerisht along wi' thyself forthright all joys we enjoyèd,\nDouce joys fed by thy love during the term of our days;\nWhom now art tombed so far nor 'mid familiar pavestones\nNor wi' thine ashes stored near to thy kith and thy kin,\nBut in that Troy obscene, that Troy of ill-omen, entombèd\nHolds thee, an alien earth-buried in uttermost bourne.\nThither in haste so hot ('tis said) from allwhere the Youth-hood\nGrecian, farèd in hosts forth of their hearths and their homes,\nLest with a stolen punk with fullest of pleasure should Paris\nFairly at leisure and ease sleep in the pacific bed.\nSuch was the hapless chance, most beautiful Laodamia,\nTare fro' thee dearer than life, dearer than spirit itself,\nHim, that husband, whose love in so mighty a whirlpool of passion\nWhelmed thee absorbed and plunged deep in its gulfy abyss,\nE'en as the Grecians tell hard by Phenéus of Cylléne\nDrained was the marish and dried, forming the fattest of soils,\nWhenas in days long done to delve through marrow of mountains\nDaréd, falsing his sire, Amphtryóniades;\nWhat time sure of his shafts he smote Stymphalian monsters\nSlaying their host at the hest dealt by a lord of less worth,\nSo might the gateway of Heaven be trodden by more of the godheads,\nNor might Hébé abide longer to maidenhood doomed.\nYet was the depth of thy love far deeper than deepest of marish\nWhich the hard mistress's yoke taught him so tamely to bear;\nNever was head so dear to a grandsire wasted by life-tide\nWhenas one daughter alone a grandson so tardy had reared,\nWho being found against hope to inherit riches of forbears\nIn the well-witnessed Will haply by name did appear,\nAnd 'spite impious hopes of baffled claimant to kinship\nStartles the Vulturine grip clutching the frost-bitten poll.\nNor with such rapture e'er joyed his mate of snowy-hued plumage\nDove-mate, albeit aye wont in her immoderate heat\nSaid be the bird to snatch hot kisses with beak ever billing,\nAs diddest thou :—yet is Woman multivolent still.\nBut thou 'vailedest alone all these to conquer in love-lowe,\nWhen conjoindd once more unto thy yellow-haired spouse.\nWorthy of yielding to her in naught or ever so little\nCame to the bosom of us she, the fair light of my life,\nRound whom fluttering oft the Love-God hither and thither\nShone with a candid sheen robed in his safflower dress.\nShe though never she bide with one Catullus contented,\nYet will I bear with the rare thefts of my dame the discreet,\nLest over-irk I give which still of fools is the fashion.\nOften did Juno eke Queen of the Heavenly host\nBoil wi' the rabidest rage at dire default of a husband\nLearning the manifold thefts of her omnivolent Jove,\nYet with the Gods mankind 'tis nowise righteous to liken,\n...\nRid me of graceless task fit for a tremulous sire.\nYet was she never to me by hand paternal committed\nWhenas she came to my house reeking Assyrian scents;\nNay, in the darkness of night her furtive favours she deigned me,\nSelf-willed taking herself from very mate's very breast.\nWherefore I hold it enough since given to us and us only\nBoon of that day with Stone whiter than wont she denotes.\nThis to thee—all that I can—this offering couched in verses\n(Allius!) as my return give I for service galore;\nSo wi' the seabriny rust your name may never be sullied\nThis day and that nor yet other and other again.\nHereto add may the Gods all good gifts, which Themis erewhiles\nWont on the pious of old from her full store to bestow:\nBlest be the times of the twain, thyself and she who thy life is,\nAlso the home wherein dallied we, no less the Dame,\nAnser to boot who first of mortals brought us together,\nWhence from beginning all good Fortunes that blest us were born.\nLastly than every else one dearer than self and far dearer,\nLight of my life who alive living to me can endear."
